            "article content: Even before Donald Trump’s shocking victory last November, the press had alreadywrittenthe story of his rise. Despitestudiesshowing that, likeall Republican candidates, well-off whites formed the core of Trump’s support, pundits zeroed in on his white working-class backers, which most commentators defined solely in terms of education (whites without a college degree).This dividing line ignored other crucial variables — such as income, self-identification, and occupation — but it fit with the popular belief that, from the office cubicle to the voting booth, the postindustrial “New Economy” separated the intelligent from the ignorant in a virtuousmeritocracy.By the time Hillary Clinton conceded to Trump, non-college whites had become conflated with both the working class and racism itself. The Trump campaign, as one punditargued, “laid bare the racial animus within the white working class and the Republican Party.”While frequently wrongheaded, the outsized attention paid to the white working class wasn’t surprising.For decades, Democratic defeats have been explained through the behavior of the working-class voters that formed the core of the party’s support in its post–Great Depression heyday. And for as long as the working class has been central to the Democratic Party, the working class has been presumed to be white.But this singular focus on the white working class — rather than the working class as a whole, in all its hues — has (perhaps unintentionally) aided and abetted neoliberalism’s ascension in the Democratic Party. The fate of workers has been lost in the shuffle, undermining both the material wellbeing and the morale of what should be the party’s voting base.Two truths about the white working class have framed the discussion of American working-class politics for more than fifty years. White workers, as political scientist Elisabeth Jacobs hassummarized, are both “substantially more liberal” on economic policy and “marginally more conservative” on cultural issues than more well-off whites. This dynamic left the post–Civil Rights Democratic Party with a choice: move right on race, left on economics, or abandon the working class completely.SinceGeorge McGovern’s landslide loss in the 1972 presidential election, the Democratic Party, under the influence of the neoliberal “New Democrats,” has chosen the final option. Rather than woo white workers with social conservatism or economic populism, the party decided towoo well-off white suburbaniteswith moderation onbothsocial and economic issues.Hillary Clinton’s campaign represented the apotheosis of this decades-long gamble. Her stunning defeat just as surely exposed it as an abject failure.In the months leading up to the general election, both Democratic strategists and political pundits predicted that Clinton was headed for a sweeping victory. Telegraphing theconsensusview, VoxcalledTrump’s nomination “a remarkable example of a major political party blowing a totally winnable national election” and referred to the nearly four-point gap between how well a generic Republican fared in the polls and Trump’s numbers as “The Trump Tax.”Central to the belief that Clinton was sailing to an easy victory was the conviction that educated suburban whites would abandon Trump and his crude racism in droves. Acting on that conventional wisdom, Clinton downplayed economic populism and zeroed in on Trump’s divisive personality and general unfitness for office.When the votes were counted, however, it became clear that educated white moderates hadn’t flocked to Clinton in anything close to the margins pundits had predicted. Even worse, Clinton’s strategy ofavoidingeconomic populism had the unintended consequence of dampening the Democratic base’s enthusiasm,drivingdownsupportand turnout among both people of color and Millennials.Nearly a year after the electoral catastrophe, Democratic elites still show few signs they’ve learned the right post-election lessons. Hillary Clinton’s new book blasts Bernie Sanders for offering “free ponies” instead of hardheaded policy.And last month, Will Marshall, one of the cofounders of the Democratic Leadership Council — the preeminent group of neoliberal Democrats in the 1980s and ’90s —joinedwith other centrist Democrats to form New Democracy, a group that once again aims to stanch the electoral bleeding among working-class whites and further court well-off whites by steering the party right —away from the “distraction,” as Marshallput it, of progressive policies like single-payer health care.By focusing on the role of white voters in Clinton’s defeat, rather than the failure of the Democrats’ neoliberal strategy, liberal pundits and party leaders are drawing the wrong conclusions from Trump’s victory. Instead of debating how to win white workers or doubling down on the misguided strategy of courting upscale whites, Democrats must train their attention on the needs of the working class as a whole.This doesn’t just mean that the party must retain its concern with racial, gender, and sexual inequalities. It means that Democrats must move beyond vague discussions of diversity and opportunity, and begin committing themselves to fighting for a more substantive justice. It means they must make a real commitment to confronting income stagnation, rising inequality, and the increasing power of the rich in American politics.Such a politics would not only win back many of the working-class whites who flipped from Obama to Trump this election. It would also increase turnout among Millennials and people of color, enlarging the Democratic base by bringing many low- and moderate-income Americansalienated from politicsback into the political system.Only by prioritizing the working class as a whole, in all of its diversity, can the Democratic Party craft the policies and messages that will create a durable electoral majority.From Working-Class Whites to Business-Class SuburbanitesBeginning in the Jacksonian Era and for more than a century after, the Democratic Party was, wholly or partly, a white supremacist institution. As a result, the cloud of racism hung over the party’s claim to represent the interests of workers and what Franklin Roosevelt would call the “forgotten man.”Yet despite the Democratic Party’s alignment with segregationist whites, the Great Depression and Roosevelt’s New Deal inaugurated a decades-long process of pulling African Americans away from the party of Lincoln and into the Democratic coalition. The economic progressivism of New Deal Democrats attracted many black voters, as political scientist Eric Schickler hasexplained, even as Southern Democrats’ continued influence meant that many New Deal programs initiallyexcludedlarge numbers of African Americans.Contrary torecentsuggestionsby liberal pundits, the New Deal didn’t succeed because of Dixiecrat racism. It succeeded in spite of it. As Schickler argues, racial and economic liberalism grew increasingly intertwined during the New Deal era, thanks to the efforts of black freedom activists, the desire of Democratic politicians to win the votes of African Americans migrating to the North, and the interracial organizing of industrial unions. The “Double Victory”campaignagainst discrimination and a tight wartime labor market helped make World War II a time ofeconomic gainsfor African Americans, and the dream of a united working class seemed more in reach than ever.Meanwhile, many Southern Democratic senators and representatives begansidingwith right-wing Republicans against both civil rights and labor measures during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. Southern Democrats were instrumental in helping Ohio Republican Robert Taft, an archconservative,deala death blow to unions with the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act (which allowed states to pass anti-union “right-to-work” statutes).Yet World War II and its aftermath changed how many left-liberals viewed the white working class. Looking at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, the Jim Crow South, and, later, McCarthyism, many American intellectuals began to ask how such “authoritarian” ideologies took root.They concluded that the answer, as sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset phrased it in an influential 1959article, lay in the white working class, whose members exhibited “greater suggestibility” and an “inability to take a complex view,” among other character flaws. Sometimes it was unclear exactly who Lipset was referring to. Manual laborers? People with low levels of education? People with low incomes? Such specifics hardly seemed to matter, though, given the seductive nature of Lipset’s thesis (which would, in time,comeunderscrutiny, though without much effect on its influence).The idea of “working-class authoritarianism” had profound implications for how liberals thought about the Democratic Party’s base. “The gradual realization that extremist and intolerant movements in modern society are more likely to be based on the lower classes than on the middle and upper classes,” Lipset noted, “has posed a tragic dilemma for those intellectuals of the democratic left who once believed the proletariat necessarily to be a force for liberty, racial equality, and social progress.” David Riesman and Nathan Glazer went even farther: liberal intellectuals, the sociologistsargued, now had more in common with Wall Street traders than with workers, especially on issues like “civil rights and civil liberties.”For a time, the question of “working-class authoritarianism” seemed irrelevant to anyone beyond a small subset of academics and pundits. The Democratic Party captured the White House in 1960 and 1964 — the latter by landslide margins — with working-class whites at the core of its coalition. But Democrats’ 1966 midterm losses and Hubert Humphrey’s defeat in the 1968 presidential contest thrust the white working class into the center of the political discussion.When signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Lyndon Johnsonsupposedlyproclaimedthat the Democrats would lose the South for a generation. The 1966 and 1968 elections seemed to prove Johnson’s apocryphal prediction correct. Southern whites withbigoted views on racefledthe Democratic Party,creatinga corresponding drop in Democrats’ overall share of working-class whites. But as Schickler and other scholars have noted, the Civil Rights Act was less a sudden disjuncture than the culmination of a slow-moving realignment that had begun during the New Deal.In fact, focusing on the Civil Rights Act’s role in transforming the Democratic coalition obscures deeper, decades-long political and economic trends in the South. Long before the 1960s, GOP leaders had begun to water down the party’s Reconstruction-era commitment to racial equality by assuring Southerners that the party would not, in the words ofPresident William Howard Taft, “interfere with the regulation by the Southern States of their domestic affairs” — a shift that helped theGOPwin elections in the region beginning in the 1920s and startdrawingSouthern whites away from Democrats in national presidential elections followingFDR’s landslide 1932 victory. The Republican Party’s growing attention to the South continued through the 1950s, when President Dwight Eisenhowerinvestedheavily in theGOP’s party infrastructure in Southern states, fostering increasing competitiveness in a once-solidly-Democratic region.Paradoxically, the New Deal’s fiscal largesse had also fueled economic conservatism’s slow ascent in the South.FDR’s conscious efforts to develop the region catalyzed the South’s economic shift from “Cotton Belt to Sunbelt,” and the bipartisan commitment to Cold War defense spending further stoked the South’s economy throughout the post–World War II era.With the Southern economy humming along, its political leaders worked to create a low-tax, union-free, pro-business environment — enabling states to poach businesses from the Northeast and Midwest andsetting offan economic race to the bottom that ultimately resulted inoutsourcing andoffshoring.For postwar “New South” politicos, the goal was to replace the South’s image as a racist backwater with a Sunbelt branding that stressed the region’s dynamic, high-tech economy. The middle- and upper-middle-class whites that inhabited the region’s fast-growing suburbs — many of them transplants from other regions — likewise rejected the overt racism associated with the old South. They instead embraced, historian Matt Lassiterwrites, a “discourse of suburban innocence that depicted residential segregating as the class-based outcome of meritocratic individualism.”In other words, the GOP’sultimate triumphin the South was, in many ways, theproductof economic development andsuburbanization.Paradoxically, the New Deal’s fiscal largesse had also fueled economic conservatism’s slow ascent in the South.A view of the Dallas skyline from a penthouse apartment in 1952. Huntington LibraryWhile Southern whites had slowly been moving to the GOP for decades, the party’s biggest advances in the region frequently came in Sunbelt suburbs — not the Deep South — during the 1960s and ’70s. In addition, asnumerousstudieshavefound, well-off whites’ shift away from the Democratic Party in the South was more pronounced than their working-class counterparts.Unfortunately, the most influential contemporary analysis of the GOP’s Southern inroads directed its attention elsewhere. Republican strategist Kevin Phillips’sThe Emerging Republican Majority, published in 1969, argued that the white working class could be united with the existing GOP base to form a durable Republican coalition.Formerly Democratic white workers, Phillipswrote, had been “elevated by prosperity to middle-class status and conservatism.” As a result of this supposed embourgeoisement, Phillips argued, the GOP no longer needed to worry that Democrats could win working-class whites with populist economic appeals. “In the future,” he predicted, “the liberal-conservative division will come on social issues.” The GOP could create a robust majority simply by fomenting racial and cultural backlash.WhileThe Emerging Republican Majoritywas less novel than it seemed — liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger had written two years earlier that “[t]he issues are no longer social or economic so much as they are cultural and moral” — the Nixon White House “devoured and relished” the book, according to reporters Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. Phillips’s blueprint came to be known as the “Southern Strategy” (one of the mostwidelyused, and widelymisunderstood, concepts in American history, which has been elevated to a catchall explanation for the Democratic Party’s post-1960s electoral downfall).Taken in by the simplicity of Phillips’s ideas — which, interestingly enough, had originated in case studies of elections in Northern cities — the Nixon administration put them into full effect in the 1970 midterms.With “the most vigorous ideological campaign of any President of this century,” the columnist James Restonwrote, the White House enthusiastically backed hard-right candidates in congressional and gubernatorial races across the country. Stumping for favored GOP hopefuls, Nixon spotlighted the racially tinged issues of risingcrime, high taxes, andwelfare, while Vice President Spiro Agnew — the closest thing the GOP had to the arch-segregationist George Wallace —denouncedDemocrats’ “pusillanimous pussyfooting on the critical issue of law and order” at every opportunity.Though he didn’t say so publicly, Nixon had his doubts about Philips’s thesis. He understood that the GOP’s economic program had little to offer voters in “blue collar suburbs.” The GOP needed to “get above the material things,” Nixon explained. “If they’re thinking economics, we lose.”Unfortunately for Nixon, white working-class voters were “thinking economics” in 1970. Inflation was running at more than 5 percent. Unemployment was rising. And the GOP did lose them. The white working class broke for the Democrats, often in higher margins than in 1966 or 1968. Though Nixon bristled publicly at the press’s portrayal of the midterms as a loss for the GOP and a failure for the Phillips strategy, privately he agreed.Within weeks of the election, Nixon embraced a new understanding of what moved working-class voters. Back in the summer of 1970, Jerome Rosow, an assistant secretary of labor, had delivered him a fifteen-pagereporton “The Problem of the Blue-Collar Worker.” Rosow’s ideas had received little attention in the run-up to the midterms, largely because they almost wholly contradicted Phillips’s thesis. Now Nixon was ready to listen.Rosow placed the concrete economic and social concerns of all workers, not just white workers, at the heart of his analysis. The working class was not comfortable and prosperous, as the “working-class authoritarianism” thesis claimed. The 40 percent of families making between $5,000 and $10,000 per year — which included not only blue-collar workers, but also those in low-paying white-collar service jobs — were facing an “economic squeeze . . . related to wage, tax and government benefit structure for the nonpoor.”While Rosow agreed that white workers harbored racial hostility, he attributed it to low levels of education and competition within the working class for scarce economic resources. Rather than foment these bigotries in order to divide workers along racial lines, Rosow recommended that Nixon pursue an array of government spending measures directed at the entire working class, including subsidized child care and housing, expanded disability insurance, educational assistance, and federal relief for rising state and local taxes.Conservatives fumed. They slammed Rosow’s proposals and encouraged Nixon to double down on the race-baiting the administration had deployed in the midterms. But Nixon dissented, instead proposing a plan to build a “New Majority” that would unite the traditionally Democratic urban white working class and the traditionally Republican suburban white middle class.In order to court suburban moderates, Nixon re-embraced the “color-blind conservatism” that he had deployed in the 1968 campaign, when Wallace’s segregationist candidacy had made capturing the right flank impossible. Nixon now understood that while suburbanites may have opposed policies like busing for integration, they also rejected the hard-right rhetoric of the 1970 midterms.To win the working-class whites who’d been “thinking economics” in the 1970 midterms, Nixon pushed his tax and spending policies to the left. He pursued substantialfiscalandmonetarystimulus. He signed notonebuttwosignificant expansions of Social Security, including disability insurance, into law. He enacted Revenue Sharing, which hepitchedas a way to reduce regressive state and local taxes, and promised direct federal relief from property taxes, which hedenouncedfor levying an “unfair and heavy burden on the poor, the elderly, the wage earner, the farmer, and those on fixed incomes.”As Nixon’s top domestic adviser, John Ehrlichman,admittedto the press, “The essence of this is redistribution.” Nixon also shocked the country byinstitutingwage and price controls, an anti-inflation tool favored by liberal Democrats and staunchly opposed by Republicans.While Nixon was busy burnishing his reelection credentials, the battle for the 1972 Democratic nomination was exposing fault lines in the party’s approach to the white working class and, relatedly, Democrats’ understanding of their party’s ideal electoral coalition.George McGovern’s successful long-shot campaign drew press attention for its appeals to antiwar youth. To many observers, McGovern’s campaign resembled Eugene McCarthy’s ill-fated 1968 primary challenge to Lyndon Johnson. McCarthy had little use for the white working class — and, in manycases, poor and working-class African Americans — insteaddrawingmost of his support from white upper-middle-class professional and college students.Events like 1970’s “hard hat riot,” thoughnotrepresentative of all white workers, seemed to confirm for many liberals both the wisdom of McCarthy’s political calculation and the validity of the “working-class authoritarianism” thesis. New Left radicals also largely abandoned the working class as a “revolutionary subject,”elevating in its placecollege students and people of color.Undoubtedly, McGovern’s antiwar stance and social liberalism attracted not only legions of college students but alsomanyof the middle-class white liberals who had turned out for McCarthy. One of McGovern’s advisers, Frederick Dutton, evenadvanceda Democratic version of the embourgeoisement thesis, predicting that expanding prosperity would soon raise the enlightened lifestyle concerns of college students and well-off suburban whites above the material concerns — and supposed social backwardness — of the white working class. (Contrary to Dutton’s predictions, McGovern’s overall performance in the general election among college-educated whites would be identical to Humphrey’s in 1968.)But despite the attention paid to McGovern’s educated supporters, the South Dakota senator’s campaign was more reminiscent of Robert F. Kennedy’sattemptin the 1968 primaries to unite people of color with working-class whites than to McCarthy’s quixotic campaign. Indeed, McGovern’s approach to the white working class was crucial to his success — a fact not lost on the Nixon campaign.McGovern sought to channel the ire of the broader working class at ‘the richer, corporations, and Republicans in power.’George McGovern in 1972. Library of Congress“Only two smart campaigns emerge, Wallace and McGovern,” a Committee to Reelect the President memo analyzing the Democratic primary field noted. Yet whereas Wallace encouraged white workers to direct their anger at (presumably black) “welfare loafers,” McGovern sought to channel the ire of the broader working class at “the richer, corporations, and Republicans in power.”This “class appeal,” the Nixon campaign memo concluded, was “bad for Republicans.” It proposed higher taxes on the rich, tax relief for the poor and working class, and generous universal social provisions, including a universal basic income and single-payer health insurance.McGovern’s fellow Democratic candidates were more likely to follow Wallace’s lead in appealing to the white working class, however. Even liberal stalwart and erstwhile civil rights champion Hubert Humphrey resorted to race-baiting in the 1972 primaries, with one of his radio adsdeclaring, in Wallace-esque terms, “Humphrey will stop the flow of your tax dollars to lazy welfare chiselers.” The party mainstream, in other words, saw Wallace’s racist pandering, not McGovern’s interracial populism, as the key to winning the white working class.By November, the economy was booming and the Vietnam War was winding down. No Democratic candidate — moderate, liberal, leftist — stood a chance of defeating Nixon, as econometric political sciencemodelsmadeclear. McGovern lost in a landslide.But however inevitable, McGovern’s loss would be taken up as a cudgel, and profoundly reshape the Democratic Party’s relationship with the working class.The Birth of the Neoliberal Southern StrategyMcGovern’s defeat created an opening for conservatives and moderates in the Democratic Party. Philosophically opposed to both McGovern’s social liberalism and economic populism, these neoliberal “New Democrats” used the South Dakota senator’s crushing loss as an opportunity to try to banish both from the party.The neoliberals called for acompletereorientationof the party’s relationship to the white working class and people of color. Since the Roosevelt era, liberal Democrats had pieced together their coalition by pairing soft social-democratic economics, which appealed to workers across the board, with support for civil rights, which solidified blacks’ loyalty to the party. But the neoliberals saw this “New Deal ethic” as an albatross.Rather than targeting working-class whites, they insisted, the party should cater to well-off white professionals. Their prescription: adopt a program of economic and social moderation, not redistribution, as the solution to inequality — be it economic, racial, gender, or sexual.This strategy had little to offer most African Americans. But the neoliberals assumed that Democrats couldignoreblacks’ substantive concerns and still win their votes in large numbers simply by virtue of not being the GOP. Blacks were, in political scientist Paul Frymer’s phrase, “electorally captured.”The pitch to pivot toward well-off whites came just as the working class needed even greater assistance. While poor and working-class people had seen great economic gains in the decades after World War II, more than half of American families in the late 1960s and early 1970s still fell below what the Bureau of Labor Statistics considered an “intermediatebudget” for a family of four, while nearly one-third fell below its “lower budget.” The rising tide of prosperity had not lifted most Americans’ boats, despite liberals’ declarations to the contrary.As the United Auto Workers notedacerbically, even the “intermediate” BLS budget assumed that a family’s toaster would last for thirty-three years and its vacuum cleaner fourteen years, that the parents in the four-person family would go to the movies once every three months, and that they would have no money for savings.Not only had the working class not become bourgeois during the post–World War II years, the income growth they’d generally seen between the New Deal and the Nixon administration was coming to an end. Income inequality once againbeganto march upward in the late 1960s, before eventuallyexplodingin the 1980s. The early 1970s would also usher indecadesofnearlystagnantwagesformostAmericans. For the more than seven in ten Americanswithouta college degree, the effect was particularly dramatic: incomes for high school–educated workersbeganfallinginrealterms.Escalating inequality unfolded against the backdrop of a larger crisis for the “growth liberalism” that had dominated economic policymaking. The 1970s would be an era of “stagflation,” a combination of high unemployment and high inflation that policymakers had previously thought impossible. More Americans found themselves out of work in the mid-1970s than at any time since the end of World War II, while inflation eroded the incomes of poor and working-class Americans atgreaterrates than those of the rich.Government fiscal policy exacerbated this growing pocketbooksqueeze. Between the mid-1950s and mid-1970s, taxes rosemuchmorefor lower- and middle-income Americans than for the well-off, who actually saw their tax burden fall.Some on the Left understood that the promises of postwar liberalism hadn’t translated into economic security for most Americans. In a 1972issueofDissentdedicated to blue-collar workers, socialist intellectual Michael Harrington dispelled the myth that the working class “no longer exists in America.” Many politicians and commentators, Harrington wrote, had been misled by the relative shift from blue-collar to white-collar work in the US economy. Most of these new white-collar jobs, he argued, were no guarantee of prosperity. Blue-collar or white-collar, this working class was bound together by one common experience: “it does not have enough money.”Harrington wasn’t alone in challenging the emerging consensus. In 1974’sThe Working Class Majority, Andrew Levison argued that the white working class was at once less prosperous and less reactionary than many pundits believed. But if it lacked resources, the working class was also becoming more diverse — necessitating a renewed attention to workers of all races.An autoworker on the assembly line in the 1970s.Left-liberal activists like Saul Alinsky and George Wiley and progressive organizations like Public Citizen and ACORN joined the cause inturningto the needs of the multiracial working and middle classes. But theircallsfor more robust solutions to poverty and inequality fell on deaf ears in a rightward-moving Democratic Party.The proto-“supply side” austerity of Jimmy Carter’s one-term presidency struck many of the chords that would soon compose the neoliberals’ siren song. Carterresistedcalls from the reenergized grassrootslabor-leftto focus on unemployment and inequality, rather than inflation, and rejected both FDR’s New Deal and Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society liberalism.“Government cannot solve our problems, it can’t set our goals, it cannot define our vision,” Carter declared in his 1978 State of the Unionaddress. “Government cannot eliminate poverty or provide a bountiful economy or reduce inflation or save our cities or cure illiteracy or provide energy.”Carter’s economic conservatism had a corrosive effect on the Democratic Party’s base. In four short years, support from working-class whites dropped yet again. According to a team of sociologists led by Lane Kenworthy, the impetuswaseconomic stagnation — a “growing share of working-class whites lost confidence in the Democrats’ ability to deliver the goods on key material issues.” Their declining prospects created an opening for “Ronald Reagan’s simple and sharply contrasting strategy for managing the economy.” (The importance of economic rather than cultural or racial issues in Democrats’ falling support in recent decades is echoed in the work of other scholars, who’vefoundthat upper-income whites attach greater significance to cultural issues than their working-class counterparts.)Even worse, once Democrats lost their advantage on the economy with these voters, they never regained it: younger generations of white workers with no loyalty to the party replaced older ones for whom the image of the Democratic Party as the party of working-class prosperity was a living memory.But neoliberal Democrats were in denial. Despite Carter’s support for inflation-fightingausterity,a supply-side tax cut, andbusiness–friendlyfiscal responsibility, they cast Carter’s loss to Reagan as a loss for the Left, just as they would whenever a Democrat, no matter how centrist, was beaten in the years to come.The Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) played a particularly important role in disseminating this kind of spin. Founded in 1985, the DLC used money from corporations like Morgan Stanley, Dow Chemical, Citigroup, and Koch Industries to swing the party decisively to the right.The DLC’s most coveted voters were upscale, suburban white moderates. In order to woo this demographic, the DLC urged the party todedicateitself to “consensual” rather than “conflictual” values, which largely meant shifting to the right on both economic and racial issues and trading a commitment to equality for a commitment to “opportunity.” Virginia governor Chuck Robb, one of the DLC’s founders,saidthe DLC’s goal was tomakethe Democrats the “party of change, the party of economic opportunity and growth, the party of strength and resolve and willingness to defend basic American values and freedom, and hopefully . . . the party of fiscal responsibility.”In 1988, the DLC helpedengineera “Super Tuesday” of Southern states, hoping it would boost New Democrat Al Gore. Instead, it aided civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, a bête noire ofneoliberalDemocrats. “I would say this to Jesse Jackson,” Gary HarttoldtheAtlantic Monthlyin 1988. “’Jesse, what are your policies? More of the same? More maintenance? More handouts?’” What the party needed, Hart explained, wasn’t Jackson’s “Rainbow Coalition,” but to become “more market-oriented in economics” and to ignore the demands of “special interests” like labor, African Americans, feminists, and the poor.The New Democrats rallied around Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, a moderate technocrat who embodied the party’s post-McGovern shift, as the responsible alternative to Jackson. Dukakis’spitchto the nation at the Democratic National Convention emphasized “competence” and eschewed “ideology.” It specifically avoided discussions of racism or class and instead stressed “old-fashioned values like accountability and responsibility.” Only after Dukakis’s loss to George H. W. Bush did the centrists who had championed himlabelDukakis a lefty.Though it didn’t prevent the Democrats from losing three consecutive presidential races, the New Democrats’ targeting of upscale whites did begin to pay off. Throughout the 1980s, Democratic presidential candidates performed almostequallywell among college and non-college whites, a key first step in what Ronald Brownstein hasdubbeda “class inversion” of the parties among white voters.Doubling down on this inversion, the New Democrats believed, was the path to victory — no matter the costs to unions, the poor, or African Americans.Clintonism’s RiseAfter Dukakis’s drubbing in 1988, the neoliberals called for Democrats to move even further to the right.In the DLC’s post-1988report, strategists William Galston and Elaine Kamarck insisted that the Democrats should distance themselves from the language of New Deal liberalism and embrace “middle-class values” like “individual responsibility, hard work, [and] equal opportunity.”The DLC’s leaders increasingly pinned their electoral hopes on Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, who became the Council’s chair in 1990. Clinton’stakeawayfrom Dukakis’s loss was as misguided as it was DLC friendly: “If we lead with class warfare, we lose.”In 1992, Clinton carried the pro-business centrism that hadsuffusedhis governorship onto the presidential campaign trail. Traditional left-liberal concerns — such as economic inequality, poverty, and racial segregation — received short shrift. He explained issues of inequality in terms of individual skills and education, not policy or political power.“[W]hat you earn depends on what you learn,” Clinton and his vice presidential nominee, Al Gore,proclaimedin their campaign book. The solution to stagnant incomes, they argued, wasn’t robust government intervention, but creating “the best educated, best-trained workforce in the world.” They had little use for unions and eagerly supported “free trade” agreements. “We believe in free enterprise and the power of market forces,” they wrote.According to Clinton, there was little that stoking the growth of the postindustrial “New Economy” couldn’t solve. As he proclaimed in his 1992 DNC acceptancespeech, “The most important family policy, urban policy, labor policy, minority policy, and foreign policy America can have is an expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs.”With his deep-rooted faith in high-tech entrepreneurialism, Clinton differed little from Dukakis. But Clinton added a crucial element: arightward turnon race. Years later, DLC acolytes woulddenyand downplay the role of racism in Clinton’s 1992 campaign. But its centrality to Clinton and the New Democrats was undeniable. As Franklin Foeradmittedin a sympathetic account, “More than any issue, race defined the rise of the New Democrats in the 1980s.”Clinton didn’t just take black voters for granted. He pointedly used African Americans as a foil to demonstrate that Democrats had abandoned racial liberalism. He snubbed Jesse Jackson, denouncedSister Souljah,executedRicky Ray Rector, and adopted punitive, racialized stances onwelfareandcriminal justice.In part, Clinton’s racial posturing was aimed at winning back working-class whites. After all, if non-college whites were to the left of the party on economic issues and to the right of the party on social issues, the New Democrats knew which way they preferred to move. But the lurch to the right on race was also designed to help Clintonwin over“white, mainly suburban, mostly middle-class voters,” who were intolerant of anything beyond an empty commitment to “equal opportunity” for African Americans.Clinton didn’t just take black voters for granted. He pointedly used African Americans as a foil to demonstrate that Democrats had abandoned racial liberalism.Bill Clinton in 1993. Library of CongressIn some ways, Clinton’s gambit succeeded. The Arkansas governor equaled Dukakis’s percentages among every group of white voters except whites with some college (among whom Clinton ran six points ahead of Dukakis). But because 1992 was a three-way race (with Texas billionaire Ross Perot finishing in a strong third behind George H. W. Bush), Clinton performed better than Dukakis as a share of the two-party vote.Still, Clinton’s ostensibly resounding win overshadowed some troubling trends. “Clinton’s ratings are about as high among affluent, educated, managers as among less-educated blue collar Americans,”Los Angeles Timespollster John Brennannoted. “Younger blue-collar males — a particularly pessimistic lot these days — remain doubtful about Clinton.” Nor were blue-collar whites the only group uncertain about Clinton.Despite New Democrats’ conviction that they could tack right on racial issues without losing African-American voters, the 1992 Democratic primariessaw“the smallest black voter turnout for a presidential primary in a decade.” In many key states, Clinton won less than half the number of African-American votes that Jesse Jackson had received during his losing campaign four years earlier. Lack of black enthusiasm for Clinton continued into the general election, both in terms ofturnoutand voteshare.But the New Democrats claimed that Clinton’s victory proved that economic and cultural centrism worked. (In truth, the force that propelled Clinton over the finish line in 1992 was Americans’skittishnessaboutthe economy.)Once in office, Clinton did little to reassure Americans uneasy about their material standing. In fact, to many members of the party’s traditional voting base, his actions had the opposite effect. Brushing aside the objections of unions and many congressional Democrats, Clintonsuccessfully advancedBush’s North American Free Trade Agreement.“Few issues in American life have produced a class schism like NAFTA,” Hart Research’s Guy Molyneuxobservedin early 1994. “People in blue-collar households, with moderate incomes, and without a college degree were all strongly opposed to the treaty. On the other side were those earning over $50,000 and four year college graduates.” In a prescient aside, Molyneux warned that blue-collar workers would hold Democrats accountable in the decades to come if it became clear that trade had cost them their jobs.By the end of his first term, Clinton was declaring that “the era of big government is over,” and that Americans were entering “the era of balanced budgets and smaller government.” Welfare was also on the chopping block.Since the program’s inception, conservatives had yearned to eliminate cash assistance to the needy (officially called Aid to Families with Dependent Children). Neither Reagan nor Bush had been able to achieve that goal. But Clinton made it a priority. Early in his reelection year, Clinton sided with Republicans against most congressional Democrats (and a fewmembersof his own administration) to “end welfare as we know it,” a policy shift thatincreaseddeeppovertyand left many of the most marginalized with nowhere to turn.This didn’t much trouble Clinton, however. Neither the blue-collar workers opposed to NAFTA nor the poor Americans hurt by welfare reform were in his targeted demographic. Instead, Clinton’s reelection campaign focused on a group of upscale white women dubbed “soccer moms.”While Clinton hadlostwhite married suburban women to Bush by nearly a two-to-one margin in 1992, polls in 1996 showed Clinton edging Dole among this group. Suddenly, the “soccer mom” vote assumed an outsized role in the imagination of Clinton strategists. The problem was, they weren’t really Democratic voters.“What makes the soccer moms so key this time is that they are voting Republican for Congress and Democratic for President,” Democratic pollster Celinda Lakeexplained. Clinton’s strategy, in other words, revolved around courting voters that would help him secure reelection, but wouldn’t provide him with the Democratic congressional majority necessary (if insufficient) to enact progressive policies. (Lake, for her part, believed Clinton should target “waitress moms” — blue-collar women who were a more traditional Democratic constituency.)On Election Day, Clinton defeated Bob Dole with hugegainsin the suburbs and among college-educated women. Yet, as Lake predicted, “soccer moms”tendedto split their tickets, pulling the lever for Clinton for president and Republicans for Congress.Not that many Clinton allies minded. New Democrats, onereportnoted, could “hardly hide their glee” that the Democrats failed to retake the House, because it meant that Clinton would have cover to reach across the aisle and make a deal on entitlement programs.After Clinton’s reelection, the DLC pushed him, in From’swords, to pursue a “fundamental restructuring of our biggest systems for delivering public benefits — Medicare, Social Security, and public education, for openers.” For New Democrats, that meant “marketplace” solutions and a “grand bargain” with Republicans that traded higher minimum Social Security benefits for partial privatization, “promot[ing] individual wealth creation and broader ownership.”“The grand bargain sketched here . . . would convert Social Security from an entitlement based on the false promise that everyone can consume more than they produce to a system that promotes savings, investment, and greater economic self-reliance,” Will Marshall, the then-president of the DLC-affiliated Progressive Policy Institute,wrote. “And it would embody a new approach to governing based on a key New Democrat insight: That in the Information Age, government’s role is not to take care of us, but to give us the tools we need to take care of ourselves and each other.”In late 1997, Clinton met secretly with House GOP leader Newt Gingrich and Ways and Means chair Bill Archer to hammer out a plan to partially privatize Social Security. “I’m prepared to take the political heat to provide political cover for the Republicans,” ClintonassuredArcher. The outlines of the deal included a hike in the retirement age and the diversion of a portion of payroll tax dollars into private accounts.In exchange for dismantling the greatest Democratic policy achievement of the twentieth century, virtually all Clinton wanted was a promise that the GOP wouldn’t try to use the projected budget surplus for tax cuts.Clinton and Gingrich planned to announce their Social Security privatization deal in 1998. Then the two would turn to overhauling Medicare. The president’s strategy was to ignore the protests of more progressive Democrats and assemble a coalition of Republicans and conservative New Democrats and Blue Dog Democrats to pass entitlement reform.Only the Monica Lewinsky scandal saved what remained of the American welfare state from Clinton and Gingrich’s clutches.The White-Collar Strategy Gains Steam — and Runs AgroundReflecting on the results of the 1996 campaign, Democratic strategistscouldn’t agreewhy Clinton had prevailed.The DLC claimed that Clinton’s centrist stances on the budget, welfare, and crime had garnered him the votes of upscale, college-educated whites. But former Clinton pollster Stanley Greenberg argued that Clinton won because working- and middle-class voters believed (incorrectly, as it turned out) that he would pursue traditional Democratic domestic priorities, including defending Medicare and Social Security.In some sense, the debate was academic. The dot-com boom lifted the economy, making Clinton a shoo-in for reelection, even if he didn’t exactly inspire enthusiasm. (Turnout in 1996 was the lowestsince1924, with less than half of eligible Americans casting a ballot.) But the discussion was of enormous importance for charting the party’s path forward.Clinton’s success emboldened New Democrats in their declarations that the party’s future lay with well-off whites. “Just as industrial workers formed the backbone of the New Deal coalition, the party needs to attract the knowledge workers who are emerging as the dominant force in the information economy,” Marshallwrotein 1997. “Liberal elites,” he claimed, were the only ones who supported “economic populism.”Likewise, Clinton pollster Mark Pennarguedthat the president’s reelection proved that blue-collar whites were now irrelevant to the Democratic Party. Attempts to appeal to the working class, he claimed, would pull the Democrats back into making a “losing class-warfare argument.”More progressive Democratic strategists pointed to warning signs obscured by Clinton’s victory. “Noncollege-educated voters in particular are deeply concerned about their ability to afford education for their children, to pay for health care, and to provide for their retirement,” Greenbergwrote. “They strongly support measures designed to hold corporations accountable and are markedly skeptical of the value of free trade agreements.” The DLC’s “elite centrist agenda” of balanced budgets and entitlement cuts, he warned, held little appeal for these voters.Clinton’s policies not only disproportionately harmed the poor and people of color — they didn’t even secure the loyalties of working-class whites. Democrats experiencedanotherdrop in support among white workers during the mid-1990s, likely as result ofNAFTAandotherClinton economic policies as well as the cultural conservatism of working-class white men.Ultimately, Clinton’s sole claim to lionization by the New Democrats came from his electoral victories and the relatively rapid economic growth of the late 1990s. However, asFiveThirtyEight’s Ben Casselman hasargued, most of the things that boosted the economy, from the rise of the Internet to the entry of the Baby Boomers into their peak earning years, had little to do with Clinton’s policies. And in gutting welfare, signing NAFTA, cutting capital gains taxes, and deregulating Wall Street, Clinton’s policies did tremendous harm to the poor and working class while helping set the stage for the financial crisis that gave us the Great Recession.“The president might not be able to conjure GDP growth out of thin air,” theAtlantic’s Derek Thompson haswritten. “But he (or she) can shape how the winnings are distributed.” Under Clinton, that distribution was upward. The Gini coefficientgrewthroughout the 1990s as the incomes of the very richestshot up.The New Democrats parried criticisms that they had abandoned the poor and working class or stoked inequality by formulating a 1990s version of the embourgeoisement thesis. In the inaugural issue of the DLC’sBlueprint Magazine, Galston and Kamarck painted a sunny picture of an American economy where “millions of Americans are surging into the ranks of the upper middle class and wealthy.”“We can discern the rise of a new learning class of workers who will dominate at least the first half of the 21st century,” Galston and Kamarck wrote. “They will be better educated, more affluent, more mobile, and more self-reliant. . . . Their political outlook and behavior will increasingly defy the class-based divisions of the old economy, and they will be increasingly skeptical of centralized, one-size-fits-all solutions.”The DLC’s founder, Al From, echoed this diagnosis. “The sharp class differences of the Industrial Age are becoming less distinct as more and more Americans move into the middle and upper-middle classes,” heargued. The Democrats should therefore give up targeting either people of color or the white working class — to say nothing of the poor — and instead go after the “affluent, educated, diverse, suburban, ‘wired,’ and moderate” members of the “rising learning class” (who also happened to be overwhelmingly white).An office in the 1990s.The DLCencouragedDemocrats to distance themselves from “special interests” and “intermediaries”: unions and organizations that represented “identity group politics,” which they equated with “separatist claims based on race, ethnicity or gender.” Anything that distracted from the New Democrats’ favored audience of well-off, fiscally conservative whites was verboten.The DLC also dismissed claims that income inequality was “the fly in the New Economy ointment.” Inequality, economists at the DLC’s think tankinsisted, had been overblown by their left critics and would “begin shrinking” soon. The only answer to inequality, they concluded, was a continued fidelity to “fiscal discipline, global competition, flexible labor markets, transparent capital markets, deregulated businesses, rapid communications, and limited government interference in markets.”A triumphalist — and, likemuchof his work, artfully misleading — 1998reportby Penn claimed that Americans were fundamentally optimistic about the “New Economy.” Penn’s survey showed that those he dubbed “wired workers” were particularly enthusiastic, while lower-income workers, blue-collar workers, younger workers, and black workers were the most pessimistic.That those most concerned about the “New Economy” represented the Democrats’ traditional voting base didn’t temper Penn’s enthusiasm — nor did thefact(omitted from Penn’s write-up) that the most common response to the open-ended question “What does the term ‘New Economy’ mean to you?” was that it was a meaningless “buzzword.”By 2000, “socially liberal and fiscally conservative” “wiredworkers” were Democrats’ hot new demographic target. “Everything that a strategist does — everything that I do as a strategist — is focused on suburban voters,” Democratic pollster Doug SchoentoldtheNew York Times.The strategy of the Republican nominee that year, Texas governor George W. Bush, was based on running against Clinton’s personal foibles and blurring the lines between Democratic nominee Al Gore’s Clintonesque centrism and Bush’s own “compassionate conservatism.” It was an argument that voters could be forgiven for believing, considering Clinton had spent the 1990s attempting to elide the differences between his party and the GOP. With seemingly few major policy distinctions, many voters viewed the race as little more than apersonalitycontest, and Gore trailed Bush throughout the summer.In a desperate attempt to avert defeat, Gore made a late-campaign foray into “mild–mannered”economicpopulism, beginning with his conventionspeech. The goal, Gore’s pollsterexplained, was to make Bush the “candidate of the wealthy and most privileged, who would potentially endanger Social Security, [and] oppose a woman’s right to choose.” The populist turn worked, bringingGorewithinstrikingdistanceof Bush.But New Democrats were apoplectic.“A redistributionist appeal doesn’t work anymore,” Fromfumed. “This is a different country. Attacking oil companies and pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies will not win elections, I guarantee you.” Gore’s populism, the DLCers warned, risked alienating the well-off whites that they had worked so hard to attract. “Once you have a class warfare message, you can’t appeal to the upper middle class,” an unnamed Clinton White House strategisttoldtheDaily News. “Democrats have to be the party of the new economy.” Neoliberal journalists likeMickey Kaus,Michael Kinsley, Mort Zuckerman, and Joe Kleinjoinedconservativepundits like George Will and Peggy Noonan in panning Gore’s populist turn.When Gore lost the Electoral College vote, DLCacolytesblamedGore’spopulism, however tepid, for his defeat. “Gore chose a populist rather than a New Democrat message,” Frommaintained. “As a result, voters viewed him as too liberal and identified him as an advocate of big government. Those perceptions, whether fair or not, hurt him with male voters in general and with key New Economy swing voters in particular. By emphasizing class warfare he seemed to be talking to Industrial Age America, not Information Age America.”However, contra From, the pollsmadeclearthat Gore’s eleventh-hour populism had staved off defeat in the popular vote by energizing the Democratic base andwinningbacksome downscale whites — allwithoutperformingworsethan Clinton had among the DLC’s prized upscale demographic. In fact, many Bush voterspreferredGore’s economic message, but voted against him because they disliked him personally or associated him with Clinton’s scandals. (The number one reason Bush voters cited for their choice: “restoring honor and dignity to the White House.”)Gore’s Electoral College loss wasn’t the only bad news for Democrats. After eight years of Clintonism, Democrats had fallen to fifty-year lows in both the US House and Senate, dropped below twenty governorships for the first time since 1970, and controlled the fewest number of state legislatures in fifty years. “The Clinton years have, in effect, equalized the strength of the two parties,” Bill Schneidernotedin theAtlanticin early 2001. “Under Clinton the Republicans made gains unmatched even during the Reagan era — and they held on to them.”Yet, thanks to the influence of the DLC, the neoliberals’ view of Gore’s loss as a loss for populism largely carried the day.In 2004, the New Democrats got what they wanted. The party nominated John Kerry. Al Frompredictedthat the Massachusetts senator’s military service and message of fiscal responsibility would both energize Democrats and win over the DLC’s coveted “moderate Republicans” and “swing voters.”“By choosing Kerry in the primaries, Democrats made an affirmative decision to continue that change and to build on the New Democrat foundation of Clintonism,” Fromwrotein July. Kerry, he continued, “stands for economic growth and opportunity, not redistribution; for expanding the middle class, not the middle-class tax burden; for national strength, not national weakness; for work, not welfare; for tackling big challenges with reforms; and for an ethic of duty and responsibility.”“Democrats are on the cusp of becoming a majority party today,” Fromgushed, “because New Democrats like Bill Clinton and John Kerry rescued the party in the 1990s.”From couldn’t have been more wrong. Bush increased his margin of victory from 2000across virtually every demographic, including women, college-educated voters, moderates, and independents. And Democrats lost four Senate seats and three House seats, giving the GOP a majority in both chambers.How had the GOP topped a DLC-approved Democrat once again? By executing a game plan that bore little resemblance to the DLC’s.Republican strategist and Bush adviser Karl Rove expected 2004 to be a close race. But rather than encourage Bush and GOP candidates to tack to the center, he applied insights from a 2001articleby conservative pundit Michael Barone, who argued that America was essentially a 50-50 country, with few truly persuadable voters. Following Barone’s thesis, Rovefocusedon turning out the Republicanbase, not only by having Bush play to dedicated GOP voters, but also by ensuring anti–gay marriage referenda wouldappearon the ballot in key states.“While John Kerry’s campaign has made an extraordinary effort to gather moderate voters to his liberal base by stressing its candidate’s decorated war record and centrist views,” theAtlanticexplained, “Rove . . . has returned to his traditional strength: motivating the base of conservative voters.”The DLC’s analysis of Kerry’s loss, meanwhile, was utterlypredictable. In direct contradiction to From’s previous writings, the DLC now blamed the party’s 2004 defeats on Democrats’ failure to “buildon Clintonism.” In a series of articles in the DLC’sBlueprint Magazine, the organization called for the party to further distance itself from cultural liberalism, military dovishness, and economic populism. The path forward on cultural issues, according to Marshall, was “values centrism,” which seemed to amount to little more than a further rightward tack on “family values” issues likeabortionandanotherattempt to trim Social Security.So shopworn and unpersuasive were the DLC’s arguments that even many mainstream pundits were beginning to question the New Democrats’ fundamental theses.Following Democrats’ 2004 losses, Chuck Toddarguedit was time for Democrats to retire “Clinton’s strategy of centrist triangulation.” While Clinton may have won in 1992, he noted, the Clintonite strategy had proven “disastrous” for the Democratic Party as a whole. “Clinton worried mainly about his own political fortunes, to the detriment of his party,” Todd wrote, adding that “perhaps the most remarkable statistic from the 2004 election is the record of those candidates for whom Clinton campaigned: all eight lost.”After back-to-back defeats at the presidential level, some Democrats began taking their first, tentative steps away from tepid centrism. With the Iraq War (which the DLCsupported) a quagmire, incomes stagnating, and inequality soaring, Democrats struck apopulisttonein the 2006midterms.And it paid off.They won the House, the Senate, and a majority of governorships in a “rout once considered almost inconceivable,” as theWashington Postput it. The Democrats madedramatic gainsamong working-class whites, cutting their deficit among the group in half from 2004, andsubstantially increasedtheir margins among Latinos and Asian Americans.By 2008, it seemed that neoliberal centrism was finally reaching its race-baiting end. The DLC had beenpositioningHillary Clinton for a White House bid since before the 2006 midterms. Now she was its preferred candidate, tapping the DLC-approved Penn as her campaignstrategist. But the candidacy of Barack Obama, who hadprominentlyshunnedtheDLC, torpedoed both her campaign’s attempts to make her nomination appear inevitable and the DLC’s coveted coalition of well-off whites.Almost immediately, Obama began pullingcollege-educatedvoters from Clinton, and he easily captured theyouth vote, too. Despite pundit handwringing about whether Obama was “black enough” to peel off African-American votes from the well-known Clinton, he gained ground quickly, andendorsementsfrom prominent black Democrats like John Lewis accelerated African Americans’ exodus from Clinton.Clinton’sonly hopeof besting Obama lay with working-class whites. But she was ill-equipped to make a convincing pocketbook appeal. The Bush years had revealed 1990s-style New Economy utopianism for the cruel joke it always was. Now Clinton was stuck trying toawkwardly and dishonestlydistance herself from NAFTA and other unpopular polices from her husband’s White House. Her initial lead over Obama on economic issuesshrankas the primary wore on.With Clinton hemorrhaging support among African Americans and little in the way of a positive economic message to sell working-class whites, the Clinton campaign decided, as political scientist Thomas F. Schallernoted, “that if they were going to lose the black vote, they might as well turn it into an advantage with other elements in the Democratic coalition, notably white working-class voters.”That meant race-baiting on a scale that would rival her husband’s performance in 1992. Earlier in the campaign, Penn had argued in amemothat Obama’s “lack of American roots” was a “strong weakness.”“I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and values,” Penn wrote, inproto-“birther” language. “Every speech [by Clinton] should contain the line that you were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century.” With Clinton down in the polls, the racial subtext in Penn’s argument became the text.Playing upon rumors that Obama was a secret Muslim, the Clinton campaigncirculateda photo of Obama wearing traditional Somali clothing. Obama’s campaign manager denounced the campaign literature as “shameful offensive fear-mongering.” Butmoreracistappealsfollowed. “Won’t a single tape of [Reverend Jeremiah] Wright going off on America with Obama sitting there be a game ender?” Pennspeculatedin a March memo. Sure enough, tapes of Wright’s sermons found their way into the press’s hands, and Clinton loudlycriticizedObama’s attendance at Wright’s church.Most significantly, the Clinton campaign argued that her strength among working-class whites made her asafer betto beat the Republican nominee in the fall. Stumping for Clinton, Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell warned that downscale whites in his home statewouldn’t votefor a black candidate, putting a key swing state in play for the GOP. And Clinton, dispensing with any campaign trail euphemisms,braggedthat she ran better than Obama “among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans.”Obama’s Campaign Successes and Governing FailuresObama’s identity meant that, almost bynecessity, his 2008 campaign couldn’t replicate the neoliberalism of a Gore or Kerry. While the 2004 DNC speech that put Obama on the political map was a pastiche of the worst centrist bromides, his past as a community organizer and his race meant that the GOP would spend the entire 2008 campaign portraying Obama as asocialistMuslimblack nationalistwho was “palling around with terrorists.” These were the kinds of attacks that DLC types had feared most, but Obama couldn’t escape them.As a result, the Obama campaign put its efforts less into winning over the mythical “soccer moms” or other moderate suburban whites and more into turning out former nonvoters andfirst-timevoters, many of whom were people of color or Millennials.Two strategy stories emerged from Obama’s campaign, and, in time, the perceived importance of each would shape future Democratic campaigns — including Clinton’s ill-fated 2016 run. One gave priority to the door-to-door people power of Obama’sground game. The other credited the role ofbig data.The campaign’s door-to-door organizing philosophy sprung from the Alinsky-inspired theories of sociologist and activistMarshall Ganz, who was known for his work with the United Farmworkers. It involved a massive network of organizers knocking on doors and making personal connections with voters in order to tap into their hopes and their values and, ideally, turn them into Obama supporters.The big data portion of the campaigndrewupon the information collected from door-to-door organizing andcombinedit with information culled from social media and other sources. Crucially, the number-crunching wasn’t a substitute for organizing. The organizing both provided the big-data operation with indispensible information and gave the campaign the bodies needed to put the data-derived insights into action.The onset of the Great Recession meant that the incumbent party had a steep uphill climb in 2008, and the Obama campaign’srelatively populisteconomic messageandstellarget-out-the-vote efforts eliminated any lingering worries that the country’s first black nominee might lose to a popular Republican. Obama defeated John McCain by seven points in the popular vote, improving upon John Kerry’s 2004 margins among virtually everydemographic, includingwhite workers.The Obama campaign put its efforts less into winning over moderate suburban whites and more into turning out former nonvoters and first-time voters.Barack Obama speaks before the Democratic National Convention in August 2008. Carol Highsmith / Library of CongressOnce in office, the biggest issue facing Obama was the Great Recession. Many pundits predicted that he would pursue aNew Dealfor the twenty-first century. Before Obama was even inaugurated,Timedepicted him as FDR on itscover, and liberal writer Peter Beinart speculated, “If [Obama] can do what F.D.R. did — make American capitalism stabler and less savage — he will establish a Democratic majority that dominates U.S. politics for a generation. And despite the daunting problems he inherits, he’s got an excellent chance.”But little in Obama’s background suggested he’d be another FDR (much less the socialist of conservatives’ paranoid dreams). Obamalackeda coherent economic philosophy, and insofar as he had one, it was that of a market-friendly “University of Chicago Democrat.” When the time came to select economic advisers, he reached back to the Clinton administration.One of the few fresh faces in Obama’s cabinet was Council of Economic Advisers chair Christina Romer. In December 2008, the Berkeley economist calculated that to fill the hole caused by the Great Recession, the economyneedednearly$1.8 trillionin stimulus. As the economy continued to deteriorate, it became clear that Romer’s estimate was, if anything,too small.But Peter Orszag, Rahm Emanuel, and Larry Summers — all Clinton White House veterans —insistedthat $1.8 trillion, or anything close to it, was too large. Substantively, they knewit wasn’t. But politically they felt it was unreasonable. Why? Because it could “spook markets,” in Summers’s words, and would quash any hope of Republican support, which Obama believed was politically desirable. In the end, the stimulus Obama signed into law was less than half the size Romer initially calculated, and nearlyone-thirdof it wastax cuts. Yet it still garneredzeroGOP votes in the House.On top of that, the technocratic bent of Obama’s advisers undercut what should’ve been the most popular parts of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Instead of doling out the tax cuts in eye-catching lump-sum checks — as Bush had done with hisstimulus— Obama’s law simply had the government withhold slightly less from each American’s paycheck, on the assumption that it would make them more likely to spend it.It was a political disaster. While it helped slow some of the economic bleeding, the stimulus was at once too small and too opaque to usher in a twenty-first century New Deal. (It also might have unwittingly fueled antigovernment sentiment: asmanyscholarshave argued, relying on hidden “tax expenditures” tends to make recipients see their benefits as a natural outcome of the market, rather than a government program.)Unlike the stimulus, Obama didn’t need Congress’s approval to attack the foreclosure crisis. The Wall Street bailout bill signed by George W. Bush had given the executive branch the authority to “prevent avoidable foreclosures.” And Obama had public opinion behind him: amajorityof Americanswantedthe administration to step in and stop foreclosures. But doing so would mean forcing the banks — one of Obama’s biggest donors — to swallow losses.The administration’s solution to the foreclosure crisis proved even more disastrous than the ARRA.As journalist David Dayenhasdocumented, Obama initially promised to pursue “cramdown” measures to provide relief to underwater homeowners. But Tim Geithner’s Treasury Department not onlyrecantedon Obama’s cramdown promise, it passed over opportunities to provide direct financial assistance to homeowners or to create a Home Owner’s Loan Corporation–type program to buy up and renegotiate mortgages.Between September 2008 and the end of 2015, more than six million Americans lost their homes. Most homeowners who applied for the administration’s program, the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) were turned down. Often servicers replicated the shady tactics that had triggered the financial crisis in the first place, “losing” applicants’ paperwork and giving them the runaround.Ultimately, as Dayen has argued, HAMP simply intensified struggling homeowners’ cynicism about the Obama administration and government action more generally. Areas where homeownerssaw their wealth evaporateduring the financial crisis (an outcome the Obama administration could’ve prevented) went for Trump in 2016. “Obama’s handling of the mortgage crisis,” Dayen writes, “may have cost Hillary Clinton the election.”If the little-known HAMP acted as a political ticking time bomb for the Democrats, the political effects of the Affordable Care Act’s shortcomings were almost immediate.During his run for the White House, Obama promised to make health care reform negotiations transparent,pledgingto televise them on C-SPAN. But once in office, Obama turned to closed-door meetings. Out of public view, the White House constructed the Affordable Care Act to win the support of insurancecompaniesand theconservativeDemocrats doing theirbidding. This meant dropping the public option, which was not only the plan’s mostprogressiveelement, but also the mostpopularwith the public.Legislatively, the administration treaded softly,eschewingcalls from progressive Democrats to pass the ACA (or even the public optionalone) using budget reconciliation — a process that would have required only fifty votes, thereby eliminating the need for support from centrist Democrats — and declining to put public pressure on wavering Democrats.For his part, Obamafailedto effectively explain the bill to the public or get voters involved in pressing for a better one. Coming off a campaign that mobilized millions of grassroots supporters, Obama could’ve used his formidable campaign organization, Organizing for America (OFA), to make Democratic holdouts feel the political heat. Instead, the Obama team demobilized OFA by rolling it into the DNC andforbadeOFAfrom pushing moderate Democrats to support the health care bill. When other progressive organizations attempted to run ads against Democratic holdouts, Obama’s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, called them “fucking retards” and told them to drop the campaign.The only pressure campaigns the White House allowed OFA and other progressive groups to engage in were those against Republicans. And when it was all said and done, Obama still didn’t garner anyGOPvotes.The recalcitrance shouldn’t have come as a surprise. On Inauguration Day 2009, Republican leaders had met with conservative activists to map out a strategy oftotaloppositionto Obama’s agenda. Their goal was to keep the economy weak, which would not only facilitate Republican victories in the midterms but also, as Senate minority leader Mitch McConnellwould later state, help make Obama a one-term president. Part of the GOP’s plan was tothwartany economic recoveryby imposing a gridlock-driven austerity.Out of naiveté or stubbornness, Obama continued trying to work with a Republican Party that had little interest in anything other than sabotaging his presidency.When his approval rating declined in 2009, Obama attributed it to his failure to achieve bipartisan consensus, not the economy’s continued sluggishness. As Ryan Lizzareported, Obama “became intent on responding to critics of government spending and, as White House memos show, he settled into the role of a more transactional and less transformational leader.”Instead of pursuing a second round of stimulus, as Romer recommended, Obama took a page out of the DLC playbook and turned his attention to budget-cutting,creatingwhat would become known as the “Simpson-Bowles” commission — little more than a platform for efforts tocut taxesfor the well-off andslash Social Security.More fatefully, Obama attempted to strike a deficit-cutting “grand bargain” with the GOP following the 2010 midterms. Many Republicans had campaigned in the midterms vowing to use the debt ceiling to force budget cuts. Rather than drawing a line in the sand and refusing to negotiate, Obama followed the advice of Chief of Staff Bill Daley — a former bank executive who believed deficit reduction would be politically popular — and David Plouffe, his new political adviser. As one administration officialtoldtheNew Republic, “Plouffe specifically said, ‘We’re going to need a period of ugliness’ — he meant with the left — so that people in the center understand that we’re not wasting their tax dollars.”In reality, the federal budget deficitrankedfarbehindjobs and the general state of the economy in Americans’ minds in both 2010 and 2011. But — in keeping with the New Democrats’ fixation on the views of Wall Street insiders and well-off whites — the Obama administration elevated the deficit and investor “confidence” to its top priority.Afterseveralabortiveattemptsto reach a “grand bargain,” the White House and congressional Republicans struck a deal to raise the debt ceiling that called for automatic across-the-board budget cuts (“sequestration”) beginning in 2013 if a different “grand bargain” wasn’t reached. It wasn’t, and the sequester took effect, to thegleeof right-wingers like Grover Norquist, whoenthused, “Sequester is the big win. It defines the decade.”Though its effects wouldn’t be felt until 2013, there was good reason for Norquist to gloat. A variety of estimates — ranging from theCongressional Budget Office, theInternational Monetary Fund, and the conservativeTax Foundationto the labor-liberalEconomic Policy Institute— suggested that the sequester would knock between one half and one and a half points off GDP growth and cost the economy more than a half a million jobs. Given the centrality of the economy toelection prospects, the sequester would’ve made victory harder for any Democratic presidential candidate come 2016.Obama’s first term ended up looking a lot less like FDR’s anda lot more likeJimmy Carter’s.The Populist PivotBy late 2011, Obama’s approvalratingswere at their first-term nadir. The public’s economic concerns had mushroomed since Obama’s inauguration, and Americans were morepessimisticabout their economic situation than they had been in 2010, when Tea Party Republicans swept the midterm elections. The president needed a new message.Obama found it in December 2011, delivering a widely coveredspeechin Osawatomie, Kansas in which he called income inequality “the defining issue of our time.” Obama distanced himself from the Wall Street bailout, admitted the recovery wasn’t reaching the lower rungs of the economic ladder, chastised the rich for distorting American democracy, and committed himself, at least rhetorically, to fighting the inequality that lay at the root of America’s problems.While Obama left unmentioned Democrats’ role in constructing the unequal economy he decried, the address —inspiredboth by the Occupy Wall Street movement and Vice President Joe Biden’s insistence that Obama strike a more populist tone — was the strongest anti-inequality speech delivered by a president since LBJ.When the general election rolled around,manypunditsargued that Obama should focus on GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s “flip-flops,” a relatively non-ideological strategy. The president’s reelection campaignstrategistsconsideredthe “flip-flop” approach, but ultimatelytooka different tack.In a marked rebuke to DLC-style, pro-business platitudes, Obama ran a campaign designed to frame Romney as the human embodiment of theforcesthat had fueled inequality and sparked the financial crisis, all whilecastingObama as a populist defender of the working and middle classes. “The onetime campaign of hope and change soon began a sustained advertising assault that cast Romney as a heartless executive, a man who willingly fires people and is disconnected from how average Americans live their lives,” theWashington Postwrote.Predictably, neoliberal Democrats promised electoral disaster if Obama continued to dance with thepopulistdevil. The DLC’s MarshalladvisedObama to abandon his strategy and instead target moderate swing voters with a “post-partisan” message that favored “GDP growth,” “fiscal responsibility,” and “creating a climate conducive to entrepreneurship and business success.”“However much liberals may yearn to run against ‘vulture capitalism’ or growing disparities of wealth and income, for example, the need to win big among moderates will likely temper Democrats’ appetite for unbridled populism,” he wrote. “And base mobilization, while always important, cannot be the centerpiece of Obama’s 2012 campaign.”The centrist Third Way think tank produced astudyidentifying “Swing Independents” as the key to Obama’s reelection. This group, Third Way insisted, saw themselves as “haves” rather than “have nots,” believed the economic system was fair, and worried more about the budget deficit than income inequality.Though Third Way didn’t specify the race or class of “Swing Independents,” their data revealed them to be overwhelmingly white and well-educated. In addition,ascriticsnoted, Third Way’s poll questions employed Mark Penn–esque creative phrasing to elicit favorable answers. More neutral polls compiled by theNation’s Ari Bermanfoundthat Obama’s populist rhetoric scored high marks. Nonetheless, pundits likeBill Kellerof theNew York Timesseized on the Third Way study and urged Obama to stop “trying out for the role of Robin Hood.”Obama faced pushback from some of his fellow Democrats, too. Then–Newark mayor Cory Booker called Obama’s attacks on Romney’s Bain Capital “nauseating.” “If you look at the totality of Bain Capital’s record,” Bookersaidon NBC’sMeet the Press, “they’ve done a lot to support businesses [and] to grow businesses.” Former president Bill Clinton also popped up tocriticizeObama’s assaults on Romney’s “sterling business career.”But despite naysaying from Clinton, Booker, and other Third Way types, the Obama campaign stayed the course.Barack Obama casts his ballot in Chicago during early voting on October 25, 2012. Obama White House / FlickrFor good measure, the campaign upped its ground game, too. The Obama team’s internalreviewof its 2008 campaign had “concluded that the single most effective medium in reaching a potential Obama voter was not TV ads or glossy mail but contact from an enthusiastic human being.” One academicanalysisfound that Obama’s local field officeadvantagehad secured him three states in 2008 — Florida, Indiana, and North Carolina — that otherwise would’ve gone for McCain.In 2012, the Obama campaign increased its field offices andexpandedits volunteer base by 80 percent. (The Democrats’ ground game also received a boost from the AFL-CIO, who contacted eight hundred thousand voters in Ohio in the final four days of the campaign alone.)Despite the Romney campaign’sconvictionthat the polls were “skewed” against the GOP ticket and that Romney’stech-centricget-out-the-vote effort would overtake Obama’s ground game, Obama triumphed by four points in the popular vote.A Democracy Corpspollconducted the night of and the night after the election found that the Obama campaign successfully tapped into the country’s “populist mood” by making Romney synonymous with Wall Street and the rich.Not only had Obama largely maintained the support of the diverse Millennial generation that had helped propel him to victory in 2008, he’d also held onto the support of a significant number of non-college-educated white voters, who — despitedisagreeingwith Obama on some social issues — turned against Romneybecausehe opposed funding for Planned Parenthood and was seen as “rich and out of touch with average people.”So broad was Obama’s backing that even if black turnout in 2008 and 2012 had remained the same as in 2004, he still would’vewon. He “would have won re-election even if he hadn’t won the Hispanic vote at all,” theNew York Times’ Nate Cohn wrote. “He would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004.”That’s because Obama did startlingly well among whites in the North, including non-college-educated whites. “Overall, 34 percent of Mr. Obama’s voters [in 2012] were whites without a college degree — larger in number than black voters, Hispanic voters or well-educated whites,” Cohn noted. Obama picked up key Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, pulling alargershare of non-college whites than in other states.In an inversion of the ideal DLC pattern, Obamalostmore ground among college-educated whites between 2008 and 2012 than among non-college whites. Hecleaned upin cities and inner-ring suburbs en route to his win, while Romney racked up his votes in rural areas and the New Democrats’ coveted exurbs and “emerging suburbs.”With Republicans in control of Congress, whatever lessons Obama learned about the vices of moderation and the virtues of populism wouldn’t be reflected in policy. But it seemed that his reelection strategy, along with the success of candidates running on a populist anti–Wall Streetmessagein the 2014 midterms, pointed the way forward for Democrats in 2016.The holdover New Democrats had other ideas.The Return of ClintonismWriting in late 2013, former DLCers William Galston and Elaine Kamarckpainteda sunny picture of the Democrats’ chances in 2016. Favorabledemographics, they argued, made Democratic dominance almost inevitable — no policy or strategy changes necessary.Galston and Kamarck weren’t alone.In the years leading up to 2016, many Democraticstrategists and punditsconfidently predicted thatshiftingdemographicswould deliver durable Democratic majorities for the foreseeable future.Variously dubbed the “coalition of the ascendant,” the “emerging Democratic majority,” and the “rising American electorate,” the new coalition supposedly rendered inevitable by demographic changes bore a striking resemblance to the one that the DLC had been pushing the party to assemble for decades. AsPoliticoexplained, it would becomprisedof “relatively upscale whites with racial and ethnic minorities,” allowing Democrats to ignore both working-class whites (whom the party now ceded to the GOP) and people of color (who had nowhere else to go besides the Democratic Party).In political terms, then, the Democrats’ new coalition would be defined by appeals to well-off whites. This necessitated, as Third Way and other New Democrats repeatedlydeclared, steering clear of economic populism and embracing a positive, pro-market message.The new common sense about a burgeoning Democratic majority would underpin the campaign of Hillary Clinton, who Democratic Party leaders had viewed as the presumptive 2016 nominee since her loss to Obama in 2008.While both Bernie Sanders’s surprisingly strong showing in the Democratic primary and theeconometricmodelspredictinga tossup in the general should’ve been a warning to party leaders, the Clinton campaign pressed onward with its strategy. And it couldn’t have asked for a better opponent than Donald Trump — or a better candidate than Hillary Clinton.In the eyes of Democratic elitesandmostpundits, Trump’s right-wing populism was tailor-made toalienateeducated suburban whites, while Clinton’s business-friendly technocratic moderation was perfectly suited to their tastes. Geoff Garin, the pollster for Clinton’s super PAC,predictedthat Clinton would make huge inroads among educated white suburbanites (even college-educated Republican men), because they were “turned off by Trump, both stylistically and by his economic approach.”In the view of Democratic Party insiders, losses among white working-class voters repelled by Clinton’s business-friendly record and attracted to Trump’s populism would be more than offset by gains among well-off whites.“For every blue-collar Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two or three moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia,” Chuck SchumertoldtheWashington Post, in a variant of the mantra he’drepeatthroughout the campaign. “The voters who are most out there figuring out what to do are not the blue-collar Democrats. They are the college-educated Republicans or independents who lean Republican in the suburbs.”Following this logic, the Clinton campaign went out of its way to charm moderate Republicans. Itoverruledthe DNC’scampaignstrategy, which called for boosting both Clinton and down-ballot Democrats by portraying Trump and the GOP as two sides of the same extremist coin. Instead, as DNC communications director Luis Miranda wrote in an email, the Clinton campaign wanted to “disaggregate Trump from down ballot Republicans” in the belief that doing so would make it easier for moderate Republican voters to cast ballots for Clinton.Clinton’s advertisements contained the least amount of policy content for a presidential campaign since at least 2000.Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a town hall meeting in Manchester, NH in January 2016. Gage Skidmore / FlickrRather than slamming Trump for his record as a rapacious businessman — as Obama had done to Romney — ClintonstressedTrump’s noxious personality. She touted every endorsement she received from Republicans, and gave billionaires likeMeg WhitmanandMichael Bloombergstarring roles in her campaign.The result, asBuzzfeed’s Ruby Cramersummarized, was a campaign that didn’t “talk about Republican extremism or Republican rhetoric or Republican ideology” and instead focused “almost exclusively about Donald Trump, his temperament, his qualifications, his character, and his fitness to serve, leaving the rest of the Democratic Party to adjust to a general election that has little to do with traditional partisan policy or politics.”More than three-quarters of Clinton’s campaign advertisements foregrounded Trump’s character. No candidatehad ever devotedsuch a large share of ads to a single issue. Less than 10 percent of Clinton’s ads addressed the economy, whereas 34 percent of Trump’s did. In fact, Clinton’s advertisements contained the least amount of policy content for a presidential campaign since at least 2000.This contrast, as astudyby the Wesleyan Media Project noted, was especially pronounced in Wisconsin and Michigan, where voters received “policy-based (and specifically economically-focused) messaging from Trump” and attacks on Trump’s “personality and fitness for office (in a sense, doubling down on the news media’s focus)” from Clinton, a decision that left “very little room for discussion in advertising of the reasons why Clinton herself was the better choice.”The Clinton campaign departed from Obama’s 2012 game plan in other ways, too. While Obama relied on a massive ground game informed by data, Clinton’s advisers — likemanyother Democrats — believed that the numbers were by far the more important factor. The Clinton campaign put its faith in an algorithm namedAda, which ran four hundred thousand simulations of the race per day in order to guide “virtually every strategic decision” the campaign made, including where to put field offices, where to campaign, and where to air television ads.This data-centric strategy not only jettisoned the Obama ground game model, it also ignored mountains of research showing that door-to-door efforts are the “gold standard” of mobilization. The Clinton campaign,Politicoreported, “believed that television and limited direct mail and digital efforts were the only way to win over voters” and “dismissed what’s known as in-person ‘persuasion’ — no one was knocking on doors.” In Michigan, for example, Clinton hadone-tenththe number of paid canvassers as Kerry had in 2004.If Clinton’s ground game fell wellshortof Obama, it also turned out to be downrightinept— a shortcoming that numerous Democrats and progressive groupspointed outbeforethe election. According to some estimates, Clinton’s use of data-driven get-out-the-vote efforts, rather than traditional door-to-door ones, may have led her campaign toaccidentallyturn out a significantnumberof Trump voters.Clinton’spartialitytoward TV ads — as opposed to door-to-door efforts — might seem irrational in retrospect. But it fit with the campaign’s overall philosophy.Clinton’s campaign was oriented toward convincing well-off moderate whites — who were already likely to vote — to desert Trump and cast their ballot for Clinton. The remaining pieces of the Democratic coalition, the Clinton campaign believed, would fall in line. As theHuffington Post’s Natalie Jacksonexplained, the Clinton campaign “didn’t make concerted efforts” to get voters in heavily Democratic, African-American areas to the polls largely because it assumed that those voters “would support the party in large numbers — which they do, when they vote.”Many liberal pundits who were bullish about Clinton’s chancesdismissedpolls and on-the-ground reports thatpredictedlowerenthusiasm and turnout among African Americans. Many of those same pundits alsopredictedthat non-college-educated whites wouldn’t vote for Trump in much greater margins than they’d voted for Mitt Romney (a prognostication given grist by Trump’s low approval ratings among this cohort early in the campaign). The same pundits were even morecertainthat Clinton would clean up among college-educated whites, particularly college-educated white women.In the final months of the campaign, the Clinton team expected a blowout. They talked of “expandingthe map” by making late plays for a handful of red states. The wonk press, whose election models predicted certain victory for Clinton, echoed the Clinton team’s confidence.Then came Election Day.The Working-Class Authoritarianism Thesis, ReduxClinton carried out the New Democratic “class inversion” strategy almost perfectly. She performed better among upscale whites than any Democrat in history. Yet not only was it not enough to win the election, it wasn’t even enough to win that demographic. Trumpprevailedamong suburbanites 49 to 45 and whites with a college education 48 to 45, and the white women Clinton targeted voted for Trump at thesameratesthat they’d gone for Romney in 2012.“Among the theories the Clinton campaign held during the election was that college-educated Republicans would be so repulsed by the prospect of a Trump presidency that many would cast a vote to prevent it from happening,”Huffington Post’s Sam Steinwroteshortly after the election. “Yet what caught the Clinton campaign off guard was both how many of these voters would ultimately hold their nose and vote for Trump anyway.”Had Trump been unable to retain a slim lead among college-educated whites, his gains among college-less whiteswouldn’thave been enough to deliver him the White House. But despite the Clinton campaign’s fervent attempts to win well-off whites — who they hoped would vote for her even if they favored down-ballot Republicans — the election saw perhaps thelowest levelof split-ticket voting in US history.The notion that Trump would turn off many affluent, moderate Republicans was naïve. As the Working Families Party’s Joe Dinkinquipped, “being a Republican voter means already having come to terms with voting for disgusting racists and sexists sometimes.”The narrowness of Trump’s victory in key Midwestern states means thatanynumberof things — FBI director James Comey’sletter, GOP-led voter suppression, etc. — can be said to have cost Clinton the election.But the real question is why the election was so close in the first place, given that Democrats had the advantage of a popular incumbent president, a historicallyweakGOP candidate, and an economy that was, at worst, a nonfactor. “She got this gift of this complete idiot who says bizarre things and hates women and she still lost,” one anonymous Clinton fundraisertoldPolitico. “They lost in a race they obviously should have won.”Yet in explaining Clinton’s loss, most pundits didn’t point to the flaws in her strategy or the fact that upscale whites weren’t as nauseated by Trump’s bigotry as liberals expected. Instead, they pointed the finger at non-college-educated whites, a group that many pundits dubiously equated with the white working class.In part, this was because the education gap in voting among whites was immense. Clintonperformedten points better among college-educated whites than Obama had in 2012. But she performed fourteen points worse than Obama had in 2012 among non-college whites.Clinton’s poor performance among this voting bloc shouldn’t have come as a surprise. After all, the Clinton campaign’s strategy explicitlyignoredthese voters. The decision not to go after them wasan ideological one. She wasintenton capturing the New Democrats’ ideal electoral cohort: “socially moderate, fiscally selfish suburbanites” — asNew Yorkmagazine’s Eric Levitz glibly put it — not blue-collar voters.“What part of Hillary Clinton’s message was aimed at less educated white voters?” Cohnaskedrhetorically. “It just wasn’t at the core of her appeal this year. It was nothing like 2012, when President Obama relentlessly focused on the middle class, Bain Capital, the auto bailout, etc.”The notion that Trump would turn off many affluent, moderate Republicans was naïve.Hillary Clinton’s campaign office in Washington DC. Lorie Shaull / FlickrNonetheless, many Democrats and liberal pundits were incredulous that Clinton had won the support of so few non-college-educated whites. To them, the notion that Clinton’s economic message should’ve connected with downscale whiteswasself–evident. And because the unemploymentratewas below 5 percent, pundit after punditdeclaredconfidently that Trump’s support had nothing to do with the economy, even when some Trump supporterssaid otherwise.Instead, pundits put forward an explanation for Clinton’s losses among non-college whites that (sometimesquiteliterally) harkened back to the “working-class authoritarianism” thesis of the 1950s and ’60s and the subsequent debates about the decline in white workers’ support for Democrats.Numerousstudiesthroughout the campaignshowedthat Trump’s supporters weremorelikely to agree with statements expressingstereotypesabout African Americans and other groups.Punditsseized on this finding, andrepeatedlyarguedthat racism alone explained Clinton’s failure to connect with non-college-educated whites.Vox’s Matt Yglesias, for example, called economics a “fake” explanation for Trump’s rise. “While plenty of people, including plenty of Trump fans, certainly have concerns about the economy, it’s racial resentment that drives who does and doesn’t support Trump,” Yglesiaswrotelast August. “Adding an economic anxiety factor to your account doesn’t actually help to explain anything.” Similarly,Slate’s Jamelle Bouiearguedthat any suggestion that not all Trump voters were motivated primarily by racism was “perverse, bordering on abhorrent.” It reached the point where ironically tweeting “Economic anxiety!” in response to a Trump supporter’s racist outburst became thejokedu jour among pundits.To be sure, a vote for Trump was a vote that, at a minimum, implied a toleration of overt bigotry. But the prevailing narrative is incomplete. Treating racism as the axiomatic explanation for Trump’s appeal to some non-college-educated whites implies that all ballots cast for Trump were motivated principally by racism, while absolving college-educated Clinton voters of racism and ignoring the real economic crisis facing many Americans.Indeed, despite the sharp lines pundits drew between the whites who backed Trump and the whites who backed Clinton, many white Clinton supporters (likemanyObama voters)sharedthe racist views of Trump’s “deplorable” supporters. For example, a little over 30 percent of Trump supporters and a little over 20 percent of Clinton supporters told pollsters that blacks are less “intelligent” than whites. (Ironically, given Clinton proponents’ attempts during the primary to portray their candidate’s coalition as the most racially liberal, surveys found that Sanders supporters were consistently theleastlikely to agree with racist stereotypes.)What’s more, thesurveyquestionsabout racial stereotypestell usmore about overt racism than about racism in a broader sense. As early as the 1970s, scholars were questioning the idea that more educated whites were more racially liberal than working-class whites in any meaningful sense. More recent research has confirmed this finding.While whites with higher education levels are less likely to express explicitly racist sentiments, they’renotmore likely to support programs to combat racial disadvantage. Likewise, whites tend to have similar scores onimplicitracialbiastests across education levels. This suggests that “social desirability bias” causes more educated whites to avoid voicing overt racism, even if racism shapes both their policy views and their unconscious biases.In the process of defending Clinton’s economic moderation against criticisms from the left, some pundits unintentionally conceded just as much. According to Clinton’sdefenders, Democrats embracing Sanders-style policies — free college, single-payer health care, and the like —wouldalienate“well-off socially liberal voters.” The clear implication, of course, is that the supposedly socially progressive, well-educated whites of the “rising American electorate” would rather support the racist, sexist, homophobic party than pay a little more in taxes to fund an expanded welfare state.Moreover, even if the fact that a greater percentage of Trump’s supporters are willing to affirm racist statements tells us something about the motivations of hardcore Trumpers, it doesn’t tell us much about the non-college-educated whites who were turned off by both candidates but ultimately voted for Trump, despite disliking many of his policies and personal traits. These “marginal” Trump voters, as even critics of the “economic anxiety” argument likeYglesiasandBouiehaveacknowledged, weren’t necessarily motivated by racism in the same way as committed Trump voters.In fact, a majority of Trump supporterssawtheir vote as opposed to Clinton, rather than for Trump. Hewonnearly 30 percent of voters who were “bothered” by his treatment of women, 20 percent of those who didn’t think he was “honest and trustworthy,” and 17 percent of those who didn’t think he was qualified to serve as president. Even more strikingly, more thanhalfof his supporters said they favored a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, rather than mass deportation.The 2016 election was a contest between twohistorically unpopularcandidates. But a record number of people who disliked both major party options turned out. “[A]n astonishing 18% of the electorate told us they had an unfavorable opinion of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,” Edison Researchreported.Notably, half of “neither” voters viewed Obama favorably. Nonetheless these voters — including many who liked Obama — broke to Trump by a decisive 49 percent to 29 percent nationally and by even larger margins in some key swing states. “[T]his,” Edison concluded, “is the group that won the election for Trump.” Trumpwon19 percent of non-college-educated whites who approved of Obama, 20 percent of those who identified as liberal, and 38 percent of those who wanted policies more liberal than Obama’s.Trump’s decisive victory among non-college-educated whites came not from self-identified conservatives, who almost always vote for the GOP, but from hisdoublingof Romney’s margin among non-college whites who identify as neither conservative nor liberal.Pollster Guy Molyneuxsurveyedand conducted eight focus groups with these “moderates.” Contrary to the common assumption that social conservatism drove this bloc to Trump, Molyneux found that they were much more socially liberal than the conservative whites who enthusiastically backed Trump. Only 36 percent of white moderates without a college degree, for example, believed that racial and ethnic diversity was bad for the nation.Non-GOP Trump voters liked verydifferentthings about Trump than the GOP base. They placed high priority on his promises not to cut Medicare and Social Security and to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. Their main worry was that Trump would turn around and cut taxes for the rich. As a group of political scientistsfound, Trump peeled off a specific portion of whites: “populists” on economic issues who hold conservative views on social issues.This group had overwhelmingly pulled the lever for Obama in 2012, making up roughly 12 percent of his coalition. “By strategic design or dumb luck,” the political scientists noted, “the Trump candidacy was able to activate a segment of the electorate that has historically not been part of the GOP electoral coalition.”Earlier this year, the results of a Roosevelt Institute/ Democracy Corpsfocus groupconfirmed both the belief that racism has put some of these voters out of reach and the argument that others can be won back with better economic appeals.Many saw Clinton as a wealthy ally of Wall Street and genuinely believed Trump’s claims that his wealth meant he wouldn’t be beholden to deep-pocketed donors. But they expect him to deliver the jobs and good, cheap health care he promised — promises he’s of course failed to keep.Two-thirds of the focus group liked Democrats like Sanders, Sherrod Brown, and Elizabeth Warren, “who support American jobs and strongly opposed NAFTA and Obama’s trade deal, support policies to protect consumers from Wall Street and reckless banks, want to get corporations to invest in their own workers and this country, want to end tax breaks for companies sending jobs overseas, and want to bar secret corporate campaign money so our government works for the middle class again.”The sobering reality for Democrats is that Clinton lost much of this group on economic issues, not “cultural” ones. While college-less white moderates enthusiastically support increased taxation of the rich and a variety of social programs, they’re convinced that most politicians only care about the wealthy and have no real interest in pursuing policies that benefit non-elites.The result is a kind of desultory fiscal conservatism, born not out of ideology, but cynicism. And the New Democratic strategy of attracting college-educated voters only serves to confirm these workers’suspicionthat Democrats, like society as a whole, “does not value people who work with their hands.”While the Clinton campaignbelievedthat it was fruitless to reach out to undecided blue-collar whites, they nonetheless expressed confidence that these voters would, in the end, support Clinton and Trump in even numbers.In reality most late-deciding votersswung toTrump — but not for the reasons many Democrats offered in the wake of the election. Despite the belief that then–FBI director James Comey played spoiler,fewwhite swing voters cited the Comey letter as the deciding factor in their vote.Diane Hessan, who conducted a longitudinal study of the same white undecided voters throughout 2016 for the Clinton campaign,notedthat these voters intensely disliked both candidates. Yet few of the major attack lines — from Clinton’s emails to Trump’s racism — moved these voters, who already thought the worst of both. What did decisively shift them to Trump, according to Hessan, was Clinton’s “deplorables” comment, which made these voters believe that “Clinton was an out-of-touch rich person who didn’t really get it.”She didn’t, and that’s because she was following the DLC’s decades-old dream of making upscale whites the center of the Democratic coalition.“Economic Anxiety” and the Multiracial Working Class“For the past eight years,” theGuardian’s Gary Youngewrotein January, “American liberals have gorged themselves on symbolism. A significant section of the population, including those most likely to support Barack Obama, have felt better about their country even as they have fared worse in it.”Indeed, near the end of Obama’s presidency, pluralities of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats still said they were “falling behind” financially — with low-income and high school–educated respondents especially likely to say so. Fewer than four in ten Democrats rated the economy as “excellent or good,” and fewer than three in ten Independents and two in ten Republicans did.Many Americans have good reason to feel anxious about their economic situation. Despite a falling unemployment rate, large swaths of the populationhaven’t seenthe fruits of the recovery, and the Great Recession itself capped decades of diminishing economic prospects.Most American households have experienced stagnant or, at best, modest income growth for the past forty years. And even this gloomy picture conceals a more depressing reality. The main source of wage growth for most households — partially because of the mass entry of women into the workforce — has beenincreasedworking hours,not increased pay. Hourly wages have been flat for most Americans since the late 1970s.While few groups of workers have fared well in the past four decades, those without college degrees have fared the worst — their median income hasfallen. The drop in high school–educated men’s incomes has beenparticularlydramatic.Thecollapsein manufacturing employment has fundamentally changed the job prospects for high school–educated Americans, and reshaped the very landscape of Rust Belt cities. Places like Gary, Flint,Youngstown, andMansfieldare shells of their former selves.And, asresearchhasshown, voters are right to point the finger at policies implemented by theClinton administrationand continued by Bush and Obama. Workers in “low-skilled” occupations have been systematicallyexposedto competition, while well-off professionals have been shielded from the same forces — gutting the working-class job market, exacerbating inequality, and stoking alienation and resentment.Whites in poor Appalachian towns like Nelsonville, Ohio that had voted for Obamaexpressedfrustration with the idea that the economy had turned around since the Great Recession. The same was true oftownsinWisconsinthat flipped from Obama to Trump.The recovery has actually exacerbated the stratification in the job market. A 2016studyby Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce found that 11.5 out of the 11.6 million jobs created had gone to workers with at least some college education. Workers with a high school diploma or less, in contrast, “have experienced no job recovery” — they’ve seen just 80,000 jobs generated compared to the 5.6 million lost during the recession, making them the only group to experience net job losses since 2007.“The human cost of these trends for workers without postsecondary education, their families, and their communities has been immense,” the Georgetown report notes. “As factories and mines have closed and office and administrative support functions have been automated, men and women without a college education . . . found themselves out of a job, often for prolonged periods of time and, in some cases, even detached from the labor force. . . . Those who were lucky enough to find another job after being laid off or displaced often did so at a price — lower wages, which often take decades to rebuild to their pre-displacement levels.”Many Americans have good reason to feel anxious about their economic situation. Despite a falling unemployment rate, large swaths of the population haven’t seen the fruits of the recovery.A worker in Chicago. Tyler Bedgood / FlickrThe bleak landscape for non-college-educated workers has interacted with race in ways that seem almost designed to boost Trump’s chances. As theNew York Times’ Eduardo Porter hasreported, recent job losses have disproportionately hit white workers, a trend that’s visible in thewagesof non-college-educated white men. In line with this observation, polls have found that non-college-educated whites are themostpessimisticgroup in America.Not surprisingly, Trump’s support wasconcentratedincountiesthat experienced high levels of tradecompetitionand job loss as a result of trade policies, as well asareaswith the weakest job growth, lowest earnings, and highest percentage of “routine” jobs. One post-electionstudyby a team of economists found that competition from China had a decisive effect on the election in states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. In many key counties that flipped from Obama to Trump, historian Mike Davishas noted, a “high-profile plant closure or impending move had been on the front page of the local newspaper [during the campaign]: embittering reminders that the ‘Obama boom’ was passing them by.”Clinton’s campaign made little effort to speak to these workers’ concerns. As theAtlantic’s Molly Ballwrote, “[Clinton’s] ‘America is already great’ message didn’t carry far beyond the degree-rich elites who are indeed doing fine these days, particularly against Trump’s message of right-wing economic populism.” Even when Clinton attempted to make her case to blue-collar whites, she lapsed into DLC speak. “I want to really marry the public and the private sector,” shetoldGeorge Packer. “I think we haven’t organized ourselves for the twenty-first-century globalization.”Clinton might have had more substantive plans on her website, but few marginal Trump voters were likely to hear about them. Trump’s message, in contrast, was crystal clear. His television adsresemblednothing so muchas a more conservative iteration of Obama’s 2008 pitch.“In Hillary Clinton’s America, the middle class gets crushed, spending goes up, taxes go up, hundreds of thousands of jobs disappear. It’s more of the same, but worse,” theannouncerin one swing-state Trump TV ad intoned. “In Donald Trump’s America, working families get tax relief, millions of new jobs created, wages go up, small businesses thrive. The American dream, achievable. Change that makes America great again.” Clinton, meanwhile, wasrunningnarrative-free commercials set to Katy Perry’s “Roar.”While the dire economic prospects facing non-college whites doesn’t excuse a vote for Trump, it helps explain it. Economic dislocation has stoked the rise of the far rightthroughouthistory. The relationship between economic distress and racism iscomplex. As Sean McElwee and Jason McDanielfound, “economic insecurity tends to increase feelings of racial resentment, and . . . white liberals and marginally attached Democrats are particularly susceptible to increased racial resentment during times of economic crisis.”Republicans can exploit whites’ economic anxiety because, unlike many people of color, whites have the racial luxury of a choice between parties. But the fact that voters in other groups don’t do the same doesn’t mean that they’re happy with the neoliberal policy consensus embodied by Clinton’s campaign.In the lead-up to the election, many pundits expressed confidence that ignoring the white working class would allow Democrats to move left on social issues, thereby energizing young people and people of color.Slate’s Bouie laid out a version of this in early October. “A Democratic Party that doesn’t need to win more than a modest minority of working-class white men is one that can lean further toward racial liberalism, to mobilize its black and Latino supporters and to win over those culturally liberal whites,” hewrote. Clinton would defeat Trump, he continued, “with a revamped Obama coalition, comprising nonwhites; young voters; and an unprecedented number of moderate, suburban whites.”What these predictions missed is that moderate suburban whites are less committed to antiracism than many commentators assume. They’re also actively hostile to the policies needed to make meaningful progress on either economic or social justice. And the other members of the “rising American electorate” need both now more than ever.The Great Recession hit people of color like a ton of bricks. The housing crisis and rising unemployment disproportionately affected African Americans and Latinos, wiping outhalfof blacks’ wealth andtwo-thirdsof Latinos’ wealth, therebywideningthe existing racialgapsin wealth inequality. Working-class people of color face the same struggles as blue-collar whites, but with the added barrier ofdiscrimination. And the factory closings that pushed some blue-collar whites away from Clinton and toward Trump have decimated the black working class by removing the ladder of opportunitythat had allowedmany white families to prosper.Many Millennials have seen their hopes for upward mobilitydashedand arefacingthe possibilitythat they might do worse than their parents. For kids born in 1940, the chance of making more money than their parents was 92 percent. Those odds have fallen for every generation since, reaching 50 percent for kids born in 1980. Nor has education been a solution. Young college graduates have also seen theirwagesfall.While journalists were busy making “economic anxiety” jokes, numerous studies showed that economic worries have increased in recent years, particularly among people of color.An ongoingsurveyby NPR’s Marketplace found that 39 percent of Americans lose sleep fretting about their personal finances, a sentiment more common among non-whites than whites. According toanother study, the percentage of Americans who have sustained a 25 percent drop in available income, due to things like job loss or medical expenses, has jumped dramatically over the past fifty years. Not surprisingly, black and Latino households are especially likely to have suffered such a decline.Four in ten Americans live in households with high or moderate levels of economic insecurity, according to a Public Religion Research Institutestudy, and this insecurity is especially acute among blacks and Latinos. Almosthalfof Americans would have trouble finding four hundred dollars to pay for an emergency expense. Across a range of measures — finding a good job, owning a home, saving for retirement, affording health care — pluralities or majorities of non-college-educated Americans across racesbelievethings have gotten harder for them in recent years.This is the dismal economic landscape that formed the backdrop of the November election. And it was clear Clinton’s message simply wasn’t speaking to people’s material realities.A pre-election focus group with young African-American voters in Cleveland, Ohio and Jacksonville, FloridademonstratedClinton’sproblemswith black Millenials. “He’s a racist and she is a liar,” a non-college-educated black woman in Cleveland said in one focus group, “so really what’s the difference in choosing both or choosing neither?” Polls showed Clinton trailing Obama by more than twenty points among African Americans in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. “There is no Democratic majority without these voters,” Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher warned in September. “The danger is that if you don’t get these voters out, you’ve got the 2004 John Kerry electorate again.”While it wasn’t 2004 redux, it wasn’t 2008 or 2012 either. A large poll by the African American Research Collaborative completed in early Novemberfoundthat black voters’ enthusiasm for the 2016 campaign was less than half of what it was for the 2012 campaign. Notably, only 18 percent of respondents cited the fact that Obama wasn’t running, while 50 percent said they didn’t like either candidate and 27 percent said the campaign was too negative. Post-election interviews with black residents in a low-income Milwaukee neighborhood revealed that many residents who’d voted in 2008 and 2012 hadn’t in 2016, anddidn’tregret it, because they disliked both Trump and Clinton.Some were sounding the alarm months before voters went to the polls. Last June, progressive journalist John Judisarguedthat the “rage” that fueled Sanders’s candidacy was a reaction to “the failure of New Democrat politics to deliver prosperity or economy security.” “Clinton and the Democrats in Washington don’t understand the level of anxiety that Americans, and particularly the young, feel about their economic prospects,” he wrote. “It can’t be addressed by charts showing the drop in the unemployment rate.”Historian Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor slammed Democrats’ “delusional happy talk about economic recovery” while the country was still experiencing unconscionable poverty rates, rising inequality, and negligible income growth. “The inattention to growing inequality, racial injustice, and deteriorating quality of life,” she predicted, “will likely result in ordinary people voting with their feet and simply opting out of the coming election.”And so they did. Clinton was hampered by lowturnoutin key Democraticgeographicareas and among key Democratic groups,especiallyMillennials and African Americans. AFive Thirty Eightanalysisfound that Clinton underperformed Obama not just in white areas with low levels of education but also in majority-minority areas with low levels of education.Obama secured thesupportof 80 percent of African Americans without a college degree, while Clintongarnered72 percent of such voters, with the main drop-off coming from those who said they planned to stay home in 2016. In Detroit’s Wayne County, for example, Clinton received nearly eighty thousandfewervotesthan Obama in 2012 — more than seven times her loss margin in the entire state — while Trump received only fifteen thousand more than Romney.The story was the same in Wisconsin’s Milwaukee County, where Clinton picked up forty thousand fewer votes than Obama in 2012, and Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County, where turnout in black precincts wasdown11 percent from four years earlier. While GOP votersuppressiontactics may have depressed turnout in Ohio and Wisconsin, states like Michiganhadn’tpassedany new voting restrictions since 2012. African-American voters didn’t show up in the same numbers there either.Simply put, Clinton not only lost the votes of many non-college-educated whites — she alsofailedto energize voters of color and young people.Zombie New DemocratsDespite Clinton’s shocking and disastrous loss, the message Democrats could take from 2016, if the neoliberals have their way, is that the partyshould“double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and college-educated white voters who were the main target of Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” Indeed, in the aftermath of the election, many punditscalledfor Democrats to fully write off non-college-educated whites and focus on flipping even more college-educated whites.The New America Foundation’s Lee Drutman hasencouragedDemocrats to work on making the party a coalition of “highly educated professional whites, especially women, and minority voters,” which he summarizes as the Obama coalition but with “even more of a role for wealthy cosmopolitans” and an even greater focus on “fiscal responsibility,” “international responsibility,” and “global businesses.” (Of course, this same logic led Drutman topredictlast March that Clinton would beat Trump and Democrats would take the Senate, since Clinton’s economic moderation would allow Democrats to “pick up enough moderate Republicans to more than compensate” for any lost “working-class votes.”)Predictably, DLC retreads have blamed Clinton’s defeat on economic populism and, indirectly, on Bernie Sanders. “The campaign with Bernie Sanders shifted the debate toward statist and redistributive solutions and not enough about how we’re going to make the economy grow and make government work better,” Will MarshalltoldtheNew Republicin a post-election interview.The DLC’s Al From sang the same tune. “Democrats should rededicate ourselves to the core New Democrat principles — opportunity, responsibility, community,” Fromwrotein theGuardian. “Economic growth,” From stated with the confidence of a man who’s written the same op-ed since the 1980s, not “redistribution,” is the answer.In January, the Third Wayannouncedthat it was dedicating $20 million “to study how the party lost its way and offer a new economic agenda for moving forward.” Of course, the think tank already knew what the study would find. Its goal,Politiconoted, “is to steer the Democratic Party away from being led into a populist lurch to the left by leaders like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren.”Likewise, Marshall’s New Democracy isurgingDemocrats to strike a tougher, more conservative tone on issues like national defense and immigration and to drop “economic victimhood and business-bashing” in favor of “knowledge economy”-focused “pro-growth tax reform; lowering [of] regulatory obstacles to innovation and entrepreneurship; [and] fiscal policies that favor investment over consumption.”But Third Way and New Democracy’s preferred strategy is exactly the one Democrats have been pursuing for the past forty years. It’s the strategy that led Democrats to enact many of the policies that Black Lives Matter activists are protesting. It’s the strategy that quickened the collapse of the American labor movement. It’s the strategy that pushed Democrats to pass a welfare reform bill that left millions of impoverished Americans worse off. It’s the strategy that convinced Democrats to wait to back marriage equality until corporate America got on board. It’s the strategy that resulted in the passage of the Affordable Care Act, rather than the extension of Medicare to all Americans. It’s the strategy that caused Democrats to back trade deals that put downward pressure on the wages of blue-collar workers of all races, while exempting white-collar workers from the same competition. It’s the strategy that gave us President Donald Trump. It’s a strategy that hasn’t worked and will never work.If college-educated whites are attracted to economically moderate, socially liberal candidates and repelled by economically populist, socially conservative candidates, it’s hard to see how the Democrats could ever stage a better matchup than Clinton versus Trump.Clinton did better among college-educated whites than any past Democrat. But it still wasn’t enough. And had the GOP run a more traditional candidate — a Jeb Bush or a Marco Rubio — it’s likely that Clinton wouldn’t have captured as many votes from college-educated whites.The reality is, most whites with a college degree are less committed to racial justice — and more wedded to GOP tax cuts — than Democrats and liberal pundits imagine. Most importantly, continuing to follow the New Democrats’ strategy will fail to grow and energize the party’s would-be base of workers and poor people of all races.In 2016, as in 2000 and 2004, the Democrats followed the advice of New Democrats, nominating a candidate who downplayed conflictual issues like inequality to woo well-off whites; in all three years they lost a presidential contest that most modelssaidwaswinnable.The New Democrats’ strategy is even more boneheaded at thecongressional level. There are only so many states and districts that contain a critical mass of people of color and well-educated whites. And even at the presidential level, that strategy assumes that simultaneously appealing to both white professionals and Latino workers, for example, will never conflict.In order to win the White House and, especially, take back Congress, Democrats will need to be competitive in states with large numbers of downscale whites. “Democrats can’t rely on increasing support in already-blue states, and it seems that key red states aren’t ready to flip yet,” theHuffington Post’s Natalie Jackson correctlynotes. “The best strategy for 2020 will be to focus on the very narrow losses in the Rust Belt and win those voters back — which probably means convincing them that Democrats are a better option for improving their economy than Republicans.”“The Democrats’ coalition of the ascendant,” one recent studynotes, “is very inefficiently distributed.” So while demographic change might help them win the popular vote, it won’t help them in the Electoral College, Congress, or state legislatures.In addition to losing the White House, as well as House and Senate majorities, Democratshave given upnearly nine hundred legislative seats at the state level since 2008. In 2016, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committeetargetedthirty-two House seats, mostly in Midwestern states. The Democrats won only eight.Unfortunately, the conservatives surrounding Trump understood the failures of neoliberalism better than many Democrats. Back in 2014, GOP pollster (and later Trump adviser) Kellyanne Conwaychampioned“a new open-mindedness to populist approaches, regardless of partisan or ideological preferences” among voters — particularly non-college-educated voters worried about the economic effects of trade.But most mainstream Republicans, still wedded to traditional business conservatism, didn’t want to listen. The best GOP elites had to offer was Frank Luntz’s idea to rebrand “free trade” as “American trade.” When Trump begantalkingaboutworkers hurt by free trade and implying that the bipartisan political establishment cared more about Wall Street than average Americans, Republican leaders bristled. “Most people don’t think, ‘John’s success comes at my expense.’ Or, ‘My success comes at your expense,’” Paul RyantoldCNBC’s John Harwood in March. “People don’t think like that. Bernie Sanders talks about that stuff. That’s not who we are.”But as the success of Trump and Sanders attests, people do “think like that.”A left populist message like the one Sanders offered had a much better shot at defeating Trump.Supporters at a Bernie Sanders campaign rally in October 2015. Phil Roeder / FlickrIt’s a reality that many liberals still don’t want to accept. Adam Davidson, NPR’s economic reporter,arguedthat Clinton was struggling among whites without a college education because Clinton avoided Trump’s demagogic promises of a better future and instead stood by the “calm, reasonable, accurate, right answer” to the problem of falling wages, which was: “Your life is going to be worse for the rest of your life.”“This is part of a bigger problem with American presidential politics selling snake oil to the voters,” Kamarckventedto theNew Republiclast June. “Everybody from Trump with his stupid fucking wall, to Sanders with, ‘Oh, free college for everybody.’ Of all the dumb things. . . . [P]eople want to believe in Peter Pan. And he’s just not there.”But people don’t want to “believe in Peter Pan.” They just want to believe that their lives, and their children’s lives, will improve.Contrary to the New Democratic conventional wisdom, a left populist message like the one Sanders offered had a much better shot at defeating Trump.Many Clinton backers believe that Sanders couldn’t have bested Trump because Trump would’veattackedSanders as, in the words of Kevin Drum, a “wild-eyed communist.” Not only would Sanders have lost, Drumclaimed in December, he would’ve been dispatched in a “landslide.” But Drum’s argument, likemanyothersagainst Sanders, relies on the same vague conventional wisdom that concluded a candidate like Trump had no chance.Even assuming that more radical candidates get penalized a point or two in the popular vote, Sanders still could’vewonby running slightly better than Clinton in key Midwestern swing states — many of which he took in the primaries. And that assumption itself is questionable. Given that Trump’s ideological extremism didn’t cost him the election, it’s worth reevaluating both the assumption that “extreme” candidates face a penalty and our definition of “extreme.”Over the past forty years, the combined influence of Republicanreactionand New Democraticconservatismhas pushed American politics to the right, particularly on economic issues, to the point where most Americans hold more progressive economic views than existing policyreflects. Sanders’s supposedly extreme positions are actually closer to average Americans’ views than those of ostensibly mainstream politicians. If anything, Trump’s win shows that breaking with the “Washington consensus” can actually buoy a candidate.Instead of Clinton’s content-less economic optimism, Sanderswould’ve assertedthat “the system had indeed been rigged, but by people like Trump, against Trump’s own supporters.” It’s a counter-argument perfectly suited to the moment. As a Democracy Corps studyfound, an economic message attacking Trump as the candidate of Wall Street and an adherent of “trickle-down” economics “performed dramatically better in consolidating Millennials, white unmarried women, and white working class women” than a message focused on Trump’s disparaging remarks and unfitness for office.Hypothetical head-to-head polling data by Reuters showed Sanders outperforming Clinton in a matchup with Trump in almost every demographic group. Contrary to claims that Sanders primarily appealed to whites, he polled four points better among people of color than Clinton.Among the less educated whites that helped Trump win, Sanders did even better. He ran thirteen points ahead of Clinton among whites without a high school diploma, eight points better among those with a high school diploma or some college, and three points better among college graduates. Sanders also outpolled Clinton among whites in all income groups except those making over $250,000. In both low-education and low-income groups, the biggest disparity in Sanders’s performance and Clinton’s in a hypothetical showdown with Trump came from voters who said they’d stay home or opt for a third-party candidate if the contest was Clinton versus Trump rather than Sanders versus Trump.Looking at the Rust Belt states Clinton lost by small margins, the contrast is even more striking. For example, in the March to June polls, ClintontrailedTrump 39.5 to 32.6 among whites with some college or less in Michigan; Sanderswonthose voters 44 to 34. Clinton’s percentage among those same votersstayedvirtually the same through Election Day, whereas Trump picked up nearly all of the undecided or uncommitted voters in that category.Sanders scored particularly high marks among young people. Acrosseveryracial category, Americans between eighteen and thirty favored Sanders over Clinton. Sanders not only tapped into the economicfrustrationsof Millennials, he also pushed their views left on a variety of issues. “He’s not moving a party to the left. He’s moving a generation to the left,” John Della Volpe, the director of a Harvard poll of young adultstoldtheWashington Postlast year. “He’s impacting the way in which a generation — the largest generation in the history of America — thinks about politics.”While it’s certainly possible that Sanders could’ve lost to Trump, it’s difficult to argue that his populism would’ve proven a more ineffective parry than Clinton’s neoliberalism.Economic Populism or Antiracist Politics: the False ChoiceIf the 2016 election demonstrated anything, it’s that the type of economic moderation needed to appeal to upscale whites also dampens enthusiasm among the other groups who are supposed to round out the “rising American electorate.”One union staffer got the prescription and remedyright:What [Clinton campaign strategists] seem to have missed is that the way to reach blacks, Latinos, and women is the same way you reach the white working class: progressive economics, and knock on their doors. And guess what? The allegedly “racist” and “sexist” white working class is cool with a multicultural coalition as long as you give them the progressive economics. On the other hand, it turns out that downplaying the progressive economics loses everyone except the skilled professionals.The notion that a neoliberal vision of equality will enthuse Millennials and people of color is New Democrat myth. Simply being slightly to the left of the GOP on social issues isn’t enough.Advancing economic populism doesn’t mean deemphasizing the fight against racism, homophobia, or any other form of oppression. Movements from Justice for Janitors to the National Welfare Rights Organization have shown that an attention to the particular forms of domination (racism, sexism, etc.) can strengthen a universal class politics, and vice versa.What the Left must guard against is the devolution of anti-oppression politics intopro-business“diversity”rhetoricandawkward pandering.The New Democrats fashioned “a strain of corporate-friendly liberalism that deploys identity-based critiques of class politics as tools for obscuring the divergent material interests of rich and poor Democrats,” asNew Yorkmagazine’s Levitz ablysummarized. For example, while Hillary Clinton’s campaign hadmuchto say about the value of women in political office and corporate boardrooms, it had little to say about the plight of the poor single mothers that the Clintons’ welfare reform bill pushed further into poverty. Clinton’s feminism was “trickle-down-feminism,” asDissent’s Sarah Jaffedubbedit.In order to move beyond the New Democrats’ failed strategy, the party must combine social justice with economic populism. It must, for example, adopt aleft feminist politicsfocused on “rethinking the length of the workday, socializing child care, decoupling Social Security and health insurance from employment, and returning to the welfare rights movement’s call for a guaranteed minimum income.”Workers of all colors want a more progressive economic vision.Onalmosteveryeconomicissue, from spending on the poor to labor unions to health insurance, larger percentages of blacks and Latinos than whites hold left-leaning views. What Clinton lacked, Belcher’s focus groupsshowed, was a message that went beyond slamming Trump as a racist. Many black Millennials were looking for a positive agenda around issues like criminal justice reform and economic justice, not just criticism of Trump. And as political scientists Keith Gaddie and Kirby Goidelfound, “working class whites are more supportive of government guaranteeing jobs and income and, in general, of equalitarian values than other whites.”Large majorities of non-college-educated Americans say that Washington DC doesn’t represent their views and that they have too little influence over politics. They think that the government does too much to help the wealthy — more than say that the government does too much to help the poor or “racial and ethnic minorities” combined.Government action to attack rising economic inequality, including raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations, isoverwhelminglypopularwith both Democrats and Independents. The percentage of the public that believes hard work leads to success has fallen nearly 15 percent in the last fifteen years. More than 70 percent of Americansagreethat “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.” A majority regards both prosperity and poverty as the result of forces beyond an individual’s control.In order to move beyond the New Democrats’ failed strategy, the party must combine social justice with economic populism.A labor union rally in Indianapolis on March 10, 2011. Dennis Leonardo / FlickrThe least financially secure Americans are the most likely to support progressive economic policies. But they also have the least coherent political views, are the least politically engaged, and the least likely to vote. Many see no point in participating in a political system they justifiably dismiss astiltedtoward the rich. They’ll continue to sit it out if Democrats don’t change their tune.A progressive politics that fails to link racism and class is just as doomed to fail. “The progressive movement,” Ian Haney-López and Heather McGheeargue, “should expand from a vision of racism as violence done solely to people of color to include a conception of racism as a political weapon wielded by elites against the 99 percent, nonwhite and white alike . . . [and should] take up the race conversationwith white voters, by directly addressing racial anxiety and its role in fueling popular support for policies that hand over the country to plutocrats.”This connection, they note, does not “equate the harms to whites and to people of color done by racism.” Rather, it makesclearto audiences of all hues what they have at stake in fighting racism. “To enlist many whites in the battle against racism,” Haney-Lópezwrites, “requires demonstrating to whites that by voting according to dog whistle appeals, they’re wrecking their own lives — their work conditions and wages, their pensions, their health care, the education and future of their children.”The most powerful messagetestedby Greenberg’s polling outfit in 2014 was one that “linked big donations to politicians advancing the interests of wealthy donors who used unlimited, secret money to make sure that billionaires’ and CEOs’ taxes remained artificially low and their loopholes stayed protected.” Most importantly, hearing that argument before proposals for a more activist role in the economy made respondents more receptive to the latter.“[W]hite working-class and downscale voters,” Greenberg writes, “are acutely conscious of the growing role of big money in politics and of a government that works for the 1 percent, not them.” Despite their support for many progressive policies, they are “only ready to listen when they think that Democrats understand their deeply held belief that politics has been corrupted and government has failed.”Without offering a positive vision that addresses voters’ substantive concerns, neither the expansion of white-collar work nor an increasing percentage of people of color will give Democrats the majorities they need to win.Contrary to the implications of both the “working-class authoritarianism” thesis and much New Democratic rhetoric, the rise of the service economy hasn’t led to the embourgeoisement of the working class. Approximately 70 percent of the countrylacksa bachelor’s degree, and these Americans are aslikelyto work in white-college jobs as blue-collar ones. Many white-collar jobs are in the low-wage service sector, and even more professional white-collar workers are experiencing proletarianization of white-collar work.“[P]rofessionals have increasingly found their work subject to the dictates of insurance companies, entertainment conglomerates and other large institutions that have imposed a bottom-line mentality,” Judispointed outin 2002. “As a result, professionals have become increasingly inclined to distinguish their priorities from those of the market and of large corporate interests.”Though they’re supposedly a generation defined by college education and white-collar jobs, a majority of Millennialsidentifyas working class, while only 35 percent identify as middle class — the lowest of any generation. Both young Americans as a whole and young working-class whites, inparticular, hold vastlymore progressiveviews onbotheconomic and socialissuesthan their older counterparts.Withineducation groups, lower-income whites vote more Democratic, while higher-income whites vote more Republican. This pattern was visible in Clinton’s loss. Her biggestgainsamong college-educated whites came with those making more than $200,000 per year; she actually won fewer college-educated whites making less than $30,000 than Obama did in 2012.Likewise, treating non-white racial groups as monoliths in a “rising American electorate” obscures crucial class fault lines.The same sense of group competition for economic resources and social status thatmotivatedsome working-class whites to vote for Trump cuts across racial lines. On measures of support for racial and ethnic diversity, the differences between non-college whites and non-college blacks and Latinos are often moremutedthan one might expect. For example, 38 percent of non-college whites say diversity is “harmful because some people feel like they no longer belong,” along with 38 percent of non-college blacks and 31 percent of non-college Latinos. Like whites, African Americansworryabout competing with Latino immigrants for jobs, and blacks aremore likelyto believe negative stereotypes about Latinos and oppose extending services to Latinos if they feel that Latinos are surpassing African Americans socially and economically.While it’s hard to imagine African Americans deserting the Democratic Party anytime in the near future, thanks to the GOP’s overt anti-black racism, the same can’t be said about Latinos.Many pundits adopted areductionistcaricature of Latino voters, assuming that immigration was the only issue that mattered to them. Despitepredictionsthat Trump’s rhetoric would usher in an era in which Latinos would give Democrats “routine and overwhelming support,” Trump quitepossiblydidbetteramongLatinos than Romney did in 2012. At the very least, a Trump-induced exodus to the Democratic Partyfailedto materialize.What these predictions overlooked is that many Latino Americans, particularly those whose families have been in the US for more than two generations,believeillegal immigration is bad for the country.Researchalsoshowsthat many Latinos harbor negative stereotypes about African Americans, particularly when they live in the same neighborhoods as blacks.Even in his most inflammatory statements about Mexican “rapists,” Trump attempted to differentiate “hard-working” Latino citizens from undocumented immigrants, a rhetorical move redolent of longstanding conservative rhetoricseparatingthe “deserving” from the “undeserving” poor.Just as Irish and Southern and Eastern European immigrants “became white” in the early twentieth century by setting themselves apart from African Americans, more Latinos are nowself-identifyingas white, and those white-identified Latinos are more likely to support the GOP.It’spossible(ifunlikely) that Latinos will “become white” en masse.More than this, however, socioeconomic and ideological differences among Latinos should not be ignored. In 2012, ObamawonLatinos with a high school degree or less by forty points, but those with at least some college education by only ten points.In part, that’s because well-off Latinosholdmany policy views that are remarkably similar to those of well-off whites — that is to say, conservative ones. From the 1940s through the 1980s,fewclass differences existed when it came to the economic or social policy views of either Latinos or African Americans. But since the 1980s, well-off Latinos and well-off African Americans have pulled away from their poorer counterparts and embraced more conservative views on issues like government spending on the poor.And the GOP will undoubtedly continue to try to exploit class divisions among Latinos.Demographics, in other words, won’t save Democrats.The Path ForwardIn the crudest terms, politics is about winning elections, then enacting policies that empower your base and secure your political advantage. For more than forty years, the GOP has followed this model almost flawlessly.Republican presidential candidates win elections by running as “compassionate conservatives” anddownplayingormisrepresentingtheirunpopularpositions (particularly on entitlement programs). Once in office, they enact policies thatenrichtheir donor base andunderminethe unions, liberal interest groups, and social programs that empower the Democratic base.Democrats have taken the opposite route. In order to placate upper-income white moderates and appeasetheircorporatedonors, Democrats oftencapitulate to— orparticipate in— Republican attacks on their own base.Since the post-McGovern triumph of neoliberalism, the Democratic Party has offered little to workers and the poor but calls for “opportunity.” Even President Obama, who focused on inequality more than any post-LBJ Democrat, refused to break free from the “opportunity” framework. He spurned a potential economic adviser simply because she’d once used the word “redistribution,” and in his inequality-focused Osawatomie speech, he stopped short of championing equality, instead vowing to make “sure that everyone in America gets a fair shot at success.”Likewise, the “Great Gatsby Curve,”releasedin June 2013 to great fanfare by Obama’s CEA chair Alan Krueger, saw inequality only through the prism of opportunity, arguing that heightened inequality made it harder for families to move up the economic ladder across generations. All too often, the Obama White House focused on inequality only as a contributing factor to another problem, be it lowsocial mobilityor sloweconomic growth. But a progressive vision that fails to see all forms of inequality as injustices in and of themselves is no progressive vision at all.While the Obama administration made some gains in reducing inequality — particularly compared to other post-1960s presidents — most of the redistribution occurred as a result of the ACA’s shifting of income from the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans to the bottom 20 percent of Americans. Little of the redistribution reached Americans above the fortieth percentile — meaning that the main policy changes undertaken during Obama’s presidency failed to unite the poor with the working and middle classes.As the administrationitself admitted, Obama’s policies countered only “roughly one-tenth of the increase in the share of after-tax income accruing to the top 1 percent over the last three decades.” The bottom 95 percent of Americans still have a smaller share of after-tax income than they did in 1979.For decades, Democrats have crafted policies that favor complex “nudges,” “kludges,” and “market-based solutions.” They’ve hoped that funneling progressive programs through the tax code instead of setting up new programs would curb conservative opposition.Yet not only have such strategies failed to blunt the GOP’s attacks on the welfare state, they’ve also created what political scientist Suzanne Mettler has dubbed the “submerged state.” By shrouding government largesse in layers of complexity, Democratshave made it seemthat such benefits are natural, rather than the product of state intervention. As a result, the recipients of this “hidden welfare state” are neither grateful to the politicians or party who enacted the programs nor committed to defending them against conservative attacks.Take the Affordable Care Act. Fearing cries of “big government” and fights with insurance companies, Democrats embraced a mandate-and-subsidy model with roots in the conservative opposition to Bill Clinton’s market-based health reform plan. The ACA is popular among low-income Americans — including low-income whites — who have benefited from the Medicaid expansion and the most generous subsidies. But the working- and middle-class Americans who benefit from its other, more complex, provisions oftenfail to realizeit.That’s because the ACA represented an attempt at redistribution within, rather than between, classes, shifting costs from the younger and the healthier to the older and the sicker. The bottom 20 percent of the populationbenefited significantly, while the rest of the population saw little improvement. Bettering the lives of the poor is of course a laudable goal, but doing so through a maze of market incentives, regulations, and tax subsidies, rather than a universal program, is a recipe for political unpopularity.As Matt Bruenig hashighlighted, the structure of the ACA generates “enormous resentment.” Working-class people just above the Medicaid eligibility cutoff see poor people just below them getting better, cheaper coverage. Indeed, because of the means-tested nature of many tax credits, Medicaid is not the only program that seemsdesignedto stoke working-class resentment at those just barely poorer than them. This dynamic isn’t unique to the ACA. Rather, it’s inherent to all mean-tested programs.With the ACA, the Democrats took ownership of the country’sfailedmodelof for-profit health insurance. Once the public option went by the wayside, the ACA became something closer to an “Insurance Industry Profit Protection and Enhancement Act,” as former health insurance executive Wendell Potterquipped, than to a universal health care bill. In the minds of many Americans, the ACA’s salient feature is the individual mandate, which forces them to purchase a product from a private company that always seems to be getting more expensive.While the GOP’s attempts to repeal Obamacare have failed and boosted the law’s popularity, its flaws remain — and Republicans are hell-bent onexacerbatingthem and sticking Democrats with the blame.Time and time again, Americans have shown their willingness todefendsimple, universal programs even when, as with Social Security, they’re funded byregressivetaxes. Democrats must embrace a universal, social-democratic model of social provision, whether in the form of single-payer health care, national child care, or guaranteed jobs. Not only are such programs more popular and politically durable, they’re also harder to tilt toward the well off — which is exactly what the GOP hasdonewith the “submerged state” of tax subsidies.New universal programs won’t be feasible, however, until Democrats give up the canard of “fiscal responsibility.” For more than thirty years, Republicans have beenplayingDemocrats for budgetary fools. Each time Democrats have pursued austerity, they’ve ended up clearing fiscal space for a subsequent GOP tax cut for the rich. Carter’s “fiscal responsibility” underwrote Reagan’s top-heavy tax cut — and then Clinton and Obama made the same mistake.Democrats’ priority must be to expand existing entitlements and introduce new ones. If the deficit balloons, the debate will then be whether to solve it with higher taxes on the rich or cuts to popular programs. That’s a debate they can win.Beyond pursuing universal programs — which will give uncommitted or unenthused workers of all races a reason to go to the polls — Democrats must push policies that will grow their potential base. As studiesdemonstrate, labor unions are a proven tool for shaping members’ opinions on a wide variety of issues. Unions also provide a key non-corporate source of campaignfunding,mobilizetheir members for broader progressivecauses and policies, and, most importantly,shifteconomicpowerdownward. A meaningful working-class politics without organized labor is a contradiction in terms.The headquarters of UNITE HERE’s Culinary Union Local 226. Peter O’Dowd / WBURFrom the CIO unions of the 1930s to the Memphis sanitation workersstrikeof 1968 to the Las Vegas Culinary Union today, unions at their best have melded the universal with the particular, fighting for economist justice while battling more specific forms of oppression. And the more oppressed the population, the more valuable unions tend to be. A study by sociologists Jake Rosenfeld and Meredith Kleykampfoundthat unions disproportionately boosted the wages of African Americans and that “black-white weekly wage gaps would be between 13% and 30% lower if union representation remained at [the] high levels [of the 1970s].”Democrats’ support for left-leaning groups must go beyond unions, too. For decades, the GOP hasworkedto put one progressive organization after another — from ACORN to Planned Parenthood — on the defensive. Too often, as in the case of ACORN, Democrats have capitulated. But groups like ACORN and Planned Parenthood are central to mobilizing Democratic voters.A stronger social movementmentalityand continued base mobilization is Democrats’ only hope for durable electoral and policy success.Finally, and relatedly, Democrats must come to understand what the GOP already does: demobilizing your opponents’ base is as important as mobilizing yours.In their pursuit of well-off whites, neoliberal Democrats have often aided groups that ultimately side with the GOP. Both Carter and Clinton cut taxes on capital gains, Clinton deregulated the financial sector, and Obama famously treated Wall Street with kid gloves after it wrecked the economy. The Democrats’ reward for kowtowing to finance has been to watch Wall Street return to the GOP fold whenever convenient —includingfollowing Trump’s victory.Instead of keeping taxes on the rich low and regulation on business light in a futile attempt to out-GOP the GOP, Democrats should work to curb the economic and political power of corporations and the well-off at every turn. Rather than stoking economic growth and elevating wages, low taxes on upper incomes have onlyboostedinequality andhandedmoney to the rich that they’ve turned around and used tolobbyfor even more regressive, capital-friendly policies.Ultimately, Hillary Clinton’s defeat can’t be attributed to the moral failings of the white working class or the political savvy of Donald Trump, but to the utter failure of neoliberals’ strategy. For too long, Democrats have privileged well-off whites over the needs of the multiracial working class.If Democrats want to have a chance going forward, they’ll have to throw out the DLC playbook.\n",

            "article content: In the race for the Democratic nomination, one figure towers above the field: the large, misshapen form of President Donald Trump. The trauma of Trump’s shock victory in November 2016, and the reign of greed, brutality, and arrogance that has followed — seemingly impervious to organized opposition — has given Trump a special standing among Democrats.The polls are unanimous: ahealthy majorityof Democratic primary voters (between60and65percent) say that it is more important to find a candidate who canbeat Trumpthan one who they agree with on the issues. This is not a standard view for voters opposed to an incumbent president. On the eve of his2004 re-election campaign, for instance, fewer than half of all Democrats said the same about George W. Bush.Across the primary campaign, Bernie Sanders and many of his supporters have argued that it is not enough to defeat Trump: we need to organize to transform the abysmal economic conditions that produced Trump, too. This is all very true.But in the meantime, there are elections to win. America simply cannot afford another Trump victory at the polls, or another four years of rapacious right-wing government. To prevent this nightmare, we must convince anxious voters that Sanders can and will throttle Trump in a general election.The truth is that Democrats genuinely like Bernie: he has thehighest favorabilityrating in the primary field, and among Democratic voters who prioritize “issues” — that is, what a president might actually try to do in office — Sandersleads the pack. Yet among the Democrats most concerned with beating Trump, Sanders currently trails. A hostile party establishment and an unfriendly media appear to have convinced many voters that Sanders is “too extreme” or “too far left” to win a general election.And as Sanders gains steam inthe early primary states,you can expect Beltway consultants and talking heads to double down on this warning. Much of the work here is done by analogy, with Sanders cast asGeorge McGovern, Jeremy Corbyn, or whichever distant historical character or faraway foreign leader seems most convenient.Of course, we don’t need to cross oceans or generations to find counter-examples: this is the same Democratic establishment that engineered the most disastrous and humiliating election defeat in US history, just three years ago, on our own soil. But you can hardly blame the centrist pundits and party insiders for taking up this line of attack. They know that their ownwatered-down brand of politicsdoesn’t speakto voters’ needs or hopes or desires. The only thing they have left is fear. And the prospect of another Donald Trump victory may be terrifying enough to convince thousands of voters to swallow whatever sour oatmeal the party leadership serves them.But this primary season, anxious Democrats should trust their guts. It turns out that the candidate they like best, Bernie Sanders, is also the candidate with the best chance to knock Trump out of the White House.While every other general election matchup seems likely to descend into the bleak and muddled culture clash of 2016, a contest between Sanders and Trump would present American voters with a stark choice: the populist who wants to win you health care and cancel your debt, or the rich prick who doesn’t care if you live or you die so long as your boss gets paid.Trump’s true electoral weakness is not his loutishness, his congenital lying, or even his personal corruption. It’s his function as a tool of the rich man’s Republican Party, and his blatant disinterest in making life better for thevast majorityof Americans livingpaycheck to paycheck.Over the last forty years, no politician in America has focused as frankly or relentlessly on the unnecessary economic hardship faced by ordinary people as Bernie Sanders. This bread-and-butter emphasis is part of what has made Sandersthe most popularpresidential candidate in the field, especially amongindependent voters. And in a general election — on a scale far larger than any primary contest — no one is better prepared than Sanders to use that popular economic weapon to annihilate Donald TrumpFrom Obama to Trump to SandersFor Democrats still scarred by the memory of November 2016, it is easy to imagine that Donald Trump is an electoral juggernaut, endowed with awesome and occult powers. But the truth is closer to the opposite: Trump is a historically unpopular leader who won a narrow electoral college victory over anequally unpopular rival.Beyond a core of die-hard Republicans, most Americans don’t like Trump at all. Since his first few months in office, Trump’s overallapproval ratinghas hovered between 38 and 42 percent, making him by far the most consistently disliked president inmodern US history. George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, the last two incumbents to lose an election, had much better numbers than Trump over their first three years in office.Even in the key swing states where he defeated Hillary Clinton — Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania — Trump’s approval rating has beenconsistently underwaterfor over a year now.Trump can be beaten, and the way to do it involves winning three key groups of voters in these Rust Belt battlegrounds: first, the Democrats and independents who backed Obama twice before turning to Trump; second, Obama voters who declined to vote in 2016; and third, the even larger group of Americans who do not typically vote at all.There is reason to believe that on purely hard-headed electoral grounds, Sanders is the Democrat with the best chance to win back disaffected Obama supporters in the Rust Belt. Targeted polling of Obama-Trump voters shows Sanders and Joe Biden with a significant edge over Elizabeth Warren inMichigan and Wisconsin; while Biden still seems strongest in Pennsylvania,the differences are small.But the real kicker is that in the 206 counties that went for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and then Trump in 2016, Sanders hasout-fundraisedall of his competitors — by a long shot. By September 2019, he pulled in 81,841 individual donations from 33,185 donors in these flipped counties. That’s roughly three times as many as Biden, Warren, or Pete Buttigieg.This high volume of individual small-dollar donations in Obama-Trump counties (and the“sticky support”it indicates) shows that Sanders hasstrong grassroots supportin those places — which makes sense, given that his political message is targeted to people whose lives get harder as elites grow richer. That captures the experience of many working-class people in the deindustrialized Rust Belt, abandoned by corporations in search of cheaper labor and higher profits elsewhere.The most detailed study of these decisive swing voters comes from two Johns Hopkins political scientists whorecently confirmedwhatother analystshaveunderstood for a while: “economic anxiety” did, in fact, play a crucial role in the 2016 election. A close look at theAmerican National Elections Survey datashows that Obama-Trump voters in 2016 were, on average, more worried about their “current financial situation” than either Romney-Trump or Obama-Clinton voters.Obama-Trump voters were also far more likely than party-line Republicans (and just as likely as party-line Democrats) to believe that “rich people buy elections,” and to support higher taxes on the rich. And they were more likely thanbothRepublicans or Democrats to oppose free-trade agreements that cost American jobs.Trump wooed and won these Obama voters, the Johns Hopkins authors conclude, with a combination of “bandwagon bigotry”and“economic populism.” In 2020, Republicans will surely attempt to fire up the bigotry machine again. If Democrats cannot answer with a credible alternative economic agenda — one that spells real change — they are doomed to lose these voters all over again, and probably the election too.Despite his residual popularity among Democrats stemming from the Obama years (now fading fast), Joe Biden cannot deliver this message.He opposes strong measures to tax the ultra-rich; it is no coincidence he hasmore billionaire donorsthan any candidate in the race, Trump included. Worst of all, Biden has no credibility as an economic populist: he has devoted much of his political life tosupporting free trade, including NAFTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and permanent normal trade relations with China.In a general election, Biden’slong recordas a friend tobanksand outsourcing businesses — not to mention his son’slucrative serviceon the board ofa Ukrainian gas company— will surely suffocate any Democratic attempt to battle Trump on economic grounds. Instead, a Biden-Trump contest stands every chance of offering a glassy-eyed sequel to the 2016 charade that put Trump in the White House. Of the two candidates polling competitively in the Rust Belt swing states, only Bernie Sanders can actually make the economic case Democrats need to win.Back to the Polls for BernieJust as important as Obama-Trump voters are the millions of Obama voters who did not cast a ballot in 2016. Any good autopsy of the last presidential election will emphasize that turnout in key states was dismal. In Wisconsin, for example, turnoutwas down3 percent from 2012, and in Ohio it was down 4 percent. In order to win, those margins need to be recovered or exceeded by Trump’s opponent in 2020.Some commentators are quick to attribute low turnout in 2016 to restrictive voting laws, implying that nothing can be done to bring voters back to the polls. But then how to explain the fact that 1.7 million people castincomplete ballotsin these states and others, declining to vote for any presidential candidate — far more than had been the case in 2012?In Michigan, Donald Trump won by about ten thousand votes, while seventy-five thousand people cast ballots but declined to register a presidential preference. Meanwhile, nearly 3 million eligible voters didn’t even bother to go to the polls.The Pew Research Center found that, nationwide, non-voters’ top reason for abstaining in 2016 was that they “did not like candidates or campaign issues.”Twenty-five percentof nonvoters cited distaste for both candidates as their rationale for staying home, compared to only 13 percent in 2012 and 8 percent in 2000.The truth is that manypeople in swing states— including many otherwise loyal Democratic voters — were notsufficiently excitedby Hillary Clinton, who they rightly associated with business-as-usual politics. And the very real “economic anxiety” that helped turn some white Obama voters toward Trump, asMalaika Jabali’s reportinghas shown, helped dissuade many black Obama voters from casting a ballot in 2016, especially in battleground cities likeMilwaukee, Detroit, and Philadelphia.The Obama voters who stayed home in 2016,one targeted surveyhas found, are focused overwhelmingly on bread-and-butter issues, with a larger share (64 percent) emphasizing the economy, health care, Medicare, and Social Security than registered voters as a whole (55 percent), or even the famously precarious Obama-Trump voters (58 percent).If you think this suggests that these critical voters might be receptive to Bernie Sanders’s message of healthcare, education, and good jobs for all, you are right: Bernie’s favorability among this group (+38 percent) far surpasses Elizabeth Warren’s (+16 percent) and exceeds Joe Biden’s (+35 percent).Rousing the Slumbering GiantBut perhaps the strongest argument for Bernie Sanders concerns a much larger group than any slice of disaffected Obama voters: the tens of millions of people, over 40 percent of the country, who typically do not vote in presidential elections.American nonvoters, including nonvoters in the battleground states, are disproportionately young, non-white, and working-class. Bernie is distinctly popular with all of these groups, suggesting that he is by far our best shot to mobilize this vast slumbering army in a general election against Trump.In the 2016 primaries, more people under thirty voted for Sanders than Trump and Clintoncombined. Today, Sanders is theoverwhelming favoritein the Democratic Party primary among young people. Trump’s approval rating among people under thirty ispathetic, but as we learned four years ago, that’s no guarantee that every young person who scorns Trump will show up to vote against him.Democrats have a choice: either nominate a challenger who excites young people and can turn them out en masse, or hand the nomination to someone who doesn’t motivate them, greasing the wheels for a Trump victory.YoungblackandLatinovoters are especially enthusiastic about Bernie. Although he currently trails Joe Biden among older black primary voters, these voters are reliable Democrats and will likely come to the polls no matter the nominee. In Rust Belt and Sun Belt swing states alike, the crucial margin of victory may come down to the Democratic candidate’s ability to bring young people of color who are typically less inclined to vote to the polls. No politician in America is better suited to do that than Sanders.And finally, an umbrella category: Sanders isthe candidate of the working class, which encompasses most young and non-white people but also plenty of older white people too.His supporters are the least likely of all the Democratic primary candidates to have acollege degree. In the primary field, Sanders receives the lion’s share ofindividual donationsfrom nurses, teachers, retail workers, servers, tech workers, truck drivers, and construction workers.By contrast, Biden gets the most donations from company presidents, attorneys, real-estate developers, and investors.People who work for a wage make up the majority of the US population, and low-wage workers make up the majority of people who don’t vote. Nearly three quarters of nonvoters in 2016 had afamily incomeof less than $75,000.If we want the sometimes- or never-voters in swing states to turn out on election day, that candidate needs to have broad working-class appeal. That candidate needs to be Bernie Sanders.Sanders has beencrushing Trumpin head-to-head polls for years now, and his lead is especially strong among lower-propensity voters. A recent SurveyUSA poll showed that in a matchup with Trump, Bernie actually runsa few points better than Biden(and much better than Warren) among voters making less than $80,000, and with voters who describe themselves as “poor” or “working class.” And those are just people who are already registered. Of the major Democratic candidates, Sanders clearly has the best chance to awakenthe sleeping giantof young and working-class nonvoters and bring them into the electorate.The United States has some of the lowest voter turnout in the world. Given the pervasive political alienation of the working class here, no single election is going to put us on parwith nationslike Belgium or Sweden, where over 80 percent of the voting age population casts ballots, compared to our paltry 55 percent in the 2016 presidential election. But precisely because the proportion of nonvoters is so large in the US, an uptick in turnout among people who don’t usually vote could be a decisive factor in 2020.Bernie Sanders can draw people who don’t normally vote out of the woodwork. Nobody else can.Class Politics at ScaleOur enthusiasm about a possible Sanders versus Trump contest isn’t confined to the prospect that Sanders will win.HowSanders can beat Trump has enormous implications for the future of American politics.First, we should remember a simple fact of scale, easy to forget if you follow politics as a vocation or an obsession: general elections are much, much larger than primaries.About 31 million people voted in the 2016 Democratic primary, one of the most hotly contested nominating contests in U.S. history. Over136 millionvoted in the general election. The same ratio applies to campaign spending: together, Clinton and Sanders spent about$445 millionin their primary race. In the general election, Clinton and Trump spent about$1.8 billion.Using the 2016 primary race as his platform, Sanders wasable to demonstratethat “radical” left-wing ideas like Medicare For All, tuition-free public college, and a $15 minimum wage actually had an enormous base of support, far beyond any niche of self-defined progressives. This revelation has already lefta deep imprinton the Democratic Party — which has absorbed much of Sanders’s program, either in fact or in rhetoric — and will probably shape American politics for years to come.A Sanders general election campaign would present an opportunity of the same kind, but on a scale roughlyfour timesas large.Huge swaths of the American public, who barely pay attention to primary politics, would suddenly find themselves considering the basic elements of Bernie’s politics for the first time: his unvarnished portrait of the war between the 1 percent and the 99 percent; his vow to deliver guaranteed health care, education and jobs to all Americans at the expense of corporate profits, CEO bonuses, and shareholder returns.This kind of basic class politics — and this kind of simple social-democratic platform —  have beenabsent from the Democratic Partyfor over half a century, and silenced in major TV and print media for at least as long. But if Sanders is the party’s nominee, these arguments will be presented to the public on a scale that we can barely comprehend.What happens when a major party candidate speaks not simply to political junkies but to 136 million voters  — or 200 million possible voters — and the message is a new kind of “Yes We Can”: not yes we can elect an inspiring fresh-faced candidate to office, but yes we can ensure the fundamental dignity of every American, and yes we can do it by breaking the tyrannical stranglehold of the billionaire class?Bernie vs. the Billionaire(s)Perhaps the most promising feature of this scenario, though, is the vivid contrast made possible by a binary choice between Sanders and Trump. (Yes, other candidates may run, but the structure of our two-party state, and the current depth of American party polarization, will drive them rapidly into insignificance.)Because Bernie’s politics emphasize class conflict, a Trump-Sanders contest promises to be not a mere clash of values and norms, of milieus and manners, but a referendum on the role of the rich and the rest in our society, with each contender representing different sides of the divide.Sanders has already given us a preview of what this will look like. When he launched his campaign in March,he contrastedhis upbringing to Trump’s, saying, “I did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers, casinos, and country clubs. I did not come from a family that gave me a $200,000 allowance every year beginning at the age of three.”He continued, “Unlike Donald Trump, who shut down the government and left 800,000 federal employees without income to pay their bills, I know what it’s like to be in a family that lives paycheck-to-paycheck.”In a rhetorical flourish that underscored the social implications of Trump’s profiteering and juxtaposed them to his own lifelong commitment to equality, Sandersadded, “I did not come from a family that taught me to build a corporate empire through housing discrimination. I protested housing discrimination, was arrested for protesting school segregation.”With Trump, Democrats have been handed a golden opportunity to agitate against the ultra-rich, personified by the billionaire who managed to bulldoze his way to the White House. But they have repeatedly dropped the ball, electing instead to focus on Trump’s buffoonery and rule-breaking at the expense of almost everything else.The current impeachment hearings — narrowly focused on Trump’s skullduggery in Ukraine rather than his obscene efforts to enrich himself and protect his class from the White House — exemplify the limits of this approach. The Democrats’ political emphasis fails to target Trump’s weakest point: the way his administration has functioned, like almost every Republican administration, as a machine totransfer wealthfrom working people to their bosses.In the 2016 campaign, Clinton left out the bread and butter and chose to wage awar of table mannersagainst Trump. Since then, the Democratic establishment and its media allies have continued to put temperament, character, and stability at the center of their opposition strategy. If you restrict your viewing to MSNBC, you would get the impression that the main problem with the orange menace is that he’s a uniquely obnoxious dinner guest, rather than a plutocrat in a country ruled by plutocrats.Establishment leaders and pundits have even made a habit of needling Trump for beinglesswealthy than he claims, the implication being that he’s an embarrassingly bad businessman. They delight in calling him a loser, when indeed Trump’s career arc is the very picture of victory in a system designed to concentrate wealth at the top and alchemically transform it into political power.Trump is the perfect symbol of the perversity of our failed capitalist economy, his presidency the ultimate grotesquerie produced by a grotesque political order. And nobody can be trusted to make this case as vividly as Bernie Sanders.While Biden waxes nostalgic for abandoned norms, and Warren celebrates the sanctity of rules, Sanders talks meat and potatoes. His independence from the donor class make it possible for him to do what Clinton didn’t and Biden won’t: leverage Trump’s presidency into an indictment of the bipartisan pro-corporate establishment. Only Sanders can say: this stops now.This strategy holds potential not only for short-term victory, but for the return of a healthy dose of class antagonism to the American political discourse. And that’s precisely what we need to build a real fight against the economic and political system that produced Trump in the first place.Gloves OffYou wouldn’t know it from mainstream media commentary, but Sanders has been relatively tender with his primary opponents so far. That’s because the rules of primary elections are different from those of general elections: primary candidates run the risk of alienating would-be supporters with harsh criticism of their opponents in a way that general election candidates typically don’t.In a general election, we might expect Sanders to behave a bit more like he did during his first Senate race against Republican megamillionaire Rich Tarrant.By 2006, Vermont was clearly trending Democratic, but just six years earlier, Republican Senator Jim Jeffords had won re-election by 40 points. Sensing an opportunity, Tarrant poured millions of his own money into the race, aiming to label Sanders — still asocialist curiosityon the national stage — as an out-of-touch Burlington radical.But Bernie tootook the gloves offagainst “Richie Rich,” activating hisbase of small donorsand lambasting his opponent’s effort to buy the election as a symptom of the rigged economy. In the most expensive Senate campaign in Vermont history, Sanders won by 33 points.If Sanders brought that kind of unbridled energy to a general election against Donald Trump, it would amount to perhaps the most high-profile spectacle of class conflict in the modern history of American electoral politics.The campaign ad practically writes itself. In 1940s New York City, two boys were born only a few years and a few miles apart.One, the son of a real-estate tycoon, grew up in awhite-pillared mansion, literally doing his paper route from the back of hisfather’s limousine.The other, the son of a penniless immigrant whose family was killed in the Holocaust, grew up in a cramped Brooklyn apartment, sleeping ona trundle bed in the living room.One, educated in the best private schools money could buy, devoted his life to the pursuit of profit and power,abusing tenants,stiffing workers, and flaunting his wealth in New York’s highest society circles.The other spent his life working in the trenches on behalf of the vast majority — protesting segregation in Chicago, protecting poor tenants in Burlington, fighting for workers in Washington, and taking aim at the pampered elite who rule the economy from their penthouses.This is a dynamic that we’ve never seen before in a presidential election. In fact, we’ve rarely seen anything like it in modern US history at all, so submerged has class politics been beneath the bipartisan pro-corporate consensus and its pablum about meritocracy and the marvels of capitalist free enterprise.The self-seeking billionaire versus the lifelong crusader for the working class: it would be potent, resonant, and emblematic of the deep economic divide that people intuitively understand but don’t yet have the language for. It would be the kind of epic symbolic rivalry in which you can imagine people taking a side for the first time in their lives.When people say that Sanders is a risk, they usually mean that his platform and his rhetoric are too far outside the Democratic political mainstream for comfort. But at this juncture in history, comfort itself is a risk. The Right has taken advantage of the public’s appetite for transformation in order to further enrich the masters of the universe. His opponents will have to take advantage of that same appetite to do the very opposite.Sanders’s ambitious agenda represents a dramatic departure from the neoliberal Democratic consensus, and that’s exactly what we need to win. If we want to beat Trump and build a countervailing force capable of taking on the systems and institutions that produced him, we can’t affordnotto nominate Bernie Sanders.\n",

And they were more likely thanbothRepublicans or Democrats to oppose free-trade agreements that cost American jobs.Trump wooed and won these Obama voters, the Johns Hopkins authors conclude, with a combination of “bandwagon bigotry”and“economic populism.” In 2020, Republicans will surely attempt to fire up the bigotry machine again.', 'And they were more likely thanbothRepublicans or Democrats to oppose free-trade agreements that cost American jobs.Trump wooed and won these Obama voters, the Johns Hopkins authors conclude, with a combination of “bandwagon bigotry”and“economic populism.” In 2020, Republicans will surely attempt to fire up the bigotry machine again.', 'If Democrats cannot answer with a credible alternative economic agenda — one that spells real change — they are doomed to lose these voters all over again, and probably the election too.Despite his residual popularity among Democrats stemming from the Obama years (now fading fast), Joe Biden cannot deliver this message.He opposes strong measures to tax the ultra-rich; it is no coincidence he hasmore billionaire donorsthan any candidate in the race, Trump included.', 'Worst of all, Biden has no credibility as an economic populist: he has devoted much of his political life tosupporting free trade, including NAFTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and permanent normal trade relations with China.In a general election, Biden’slong recordas a friend tobanksand outsourcing businesses — not to mention his son’slucrative serviceon the board ofa Ukrainian gas company— will surely suffocate any Democratic attempt to battle Trump on economic grounds.

            "article content: Even before Donald Trump’s shocking victory last November, the press had alreadywrittenthe story of his rise. Despitestudiesshowing that, likeall Republican candidates, well-off whites formed the core of Trump’s support, pundits zeroed in on his white working-class backers, which most commentators defined solely in terms of education (whites without a college degree).This dividing line ignored other crucial variables — such as income, self-identification, and occupation — but it fit with the popular belief that, from the office cubicle to the voting booth, the postindustrial “New Economy” separated the intelligent from the ignorant in a virtuousmeritocracy.By the time Hillary Clinton conceded to Trump, non-college whites had become conflated with both the working class and racism itself. The Trump campaign, as one punditargued, “laid bare the racial animus within the white working class and the Republican Party.”While frequently wrongheaded, the outsized attention paid to the white working class wasn’t surprising.For decades, Democratic defeats have been explained through the behavior of the working-class voters that formed the core of the party’s support in its post–Great Depression heyday. And for as long as the working class has been central to the Democratic Party, the working class has been presumed to be white.But this singular focus on the white working class — rather than the working class as a whole, in all its hues — has (perhaps unintentionally) aided and abetted neoliberalism’s ascension in the Democratic Party. The fate of workers has been lost in the shuffle, undermining both the material wellbeing and the morale of what should be the party’s voting base.Two truths about the white working class have framed the discussion of American working-class politics for more than fifty years. White workers, as political scientist Elisabeth Jacobs hassummarized, are both “substantially more liberal” on economic policy and “marginally more conservative” on cultural issues than more well-off whites. This dynamic left the post–Civil Rights Democratic Party with a choice: move right on race, left on economics, or abandon the working class completely.SinceGeorge McGovern’s landslide loss in the 1972 presidential election, the Democratic Party, under the influence of the neoliberal “New Democrats,” has chosen the final option. Rather than woo white workers with social conservatism or economic populism, the party decided towoo well-off white suburbaniteswith moderation onbothsocial and economic issues.Hillary Clinton’s campaign represented the apotheosis of this decades-long gamble. Her stunning defeat just as surely exposed it as an abject failure.In the months leading up to the general election, both Democratic strategists and political pundits predicted that Clinton was headed for a sweeping victory. Telegraphing theconsensusview, VoxcalledTrump’s nomination “a remarkable example of a major political party blowing a totally winnable national election” and referred to the nearly four-point gap between how well a generic Republican fared in the polls and Trump’s numbers as “The Trump Tax.”Central to the belief that Clinton was sailing to an easy victory was the conviction that educated suburban whites would abandon Trump and his crude racism in droves. Acting on that conventional wisdom, Clinton downplayed economic populism and zeroed in on Trump’s divisive personality and general unfitness for office.When the votes were counted, however, it became clear that educated white moderates hadn’t flocked to Clinton in anything close to the margins pundits had predicted. Even worse, Clinton’s strategy ofavoidingeconomic populism had the unintended consequence of dampening the Democratic base’s enthusiasm,drivingdownsupportand turnout among both people of color and Millennials.Nearly a year after the electoral catastrophe, Democratic elites still show few signs they’ve learned the right post-election lessons. Hillary Clinton’s new book blasts Bernie Sanders for offering “free ponies” instead of hardheaded policy.And last month, Will Marshall, one of the cofounders of the Democratic Leadership Council — the preeminent group of neoliberal Democrats in the 1980s and ’90s —joinedwith other centrist Democrats to form New Democracy, a group that once again aims to stanch the electoral bleeding among working-class whites and further court well-off whites by steering the party right —away from the “distraction,” as Marshallput it, of progressive policies like single-payer health care.By focusing on the role of white voters in Clinton’s defeat, rather than the failure of the Democrats’ neoliberal strategy, liberal pundits and party leaders are drawing the wrong conclusions from Trump’s victory. Instead of debating how to win white workers or doubling down on the misguided strategy of courting upscale whites, Democrats must train their attention on the needs of the working class as a whole.This doesn’t just mean that the party must retain its concern with racial, gender, and sexual inequalities. It means that Democrats must move beyond vague discussions of diversity and opportunity, and begin committing themselves to fighting for a more substantive justice. It means they must make a real commitment to confronting income stagnation, rising inequality, and the increasing power of the rich in American politics.Such a politics would not only win back many of the working-class whites who flipped from Obama to Trump this election. It would also increase turnout among Millennials and people of color, enlarging the Democratic base by bringing many low- and moderate-income Americansalienated from politicsback into the political system.Only by prioritizing the working class as a whole, in all of its diversity, can the Democratic Party craft the policies and messages that will create a durable electoral majority.From Working-Class Whites to Business-Class SuburbanitesBeginning in the Jacksonian Era and for more than a century after, the Democratic Party was, wholly or partly, a white supremacist institution. As a result, the cloud of racism hung over the party’s claim to represent the interests of workers and what Franklin Roosevelt would call the “forgotten man.”Yet despite the Democratic Party’s alignment with segregationist whites, the Great Depression and Roosevelt’s New Deal inaugurated a decades-long process of pulling African Americans away from the party of Lincoln and into the Democratic coalition. The economic progressivism of New Deal Democrats attracted many black voters, as political scientist Eric Schickler hasexplained, even as Southern Democrats’ continued influence meant that many New Deal programs initiallyexcludedlarge numbers of African Americans.Contrary torecentsuggestionsby liberal pundits, the New Deal didn’t succeed because of Dixiecrat racism. It succeeded in spite of it. As Schickler argues, racial and economic liberalism grew increasingly intertwined during the New Deal era, thanks to the efforts of black freedom activists, the desire of Democratic politicians to win the votes of African Americans migrating to the North, and the interracial organizing of industrial unions. The “Double Victory”campaignagainst discrimination and a tight wartime labor market helped make World War II a time ofeconomic gainsfor African Americans, and the dream of a united working class seemed more in reach than ever.Meanwhile, many Southern Democratic senators and representatives begansidingwith right-wing Republicans against both civil rights and labor measures during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. Southern Democrats were instrumental in helping Ohio Republican Robert Taft, an archconservative,deala death blow to unions with the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act (which allowed states to pass anti-union “right-to-work” statutes).Yet World War II and its aftermath changed how many left-liberals viewed the white working class. Looking at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, the Jim Crow South, and, later, McCarthyism, many American intellectuals began to ask how such “authoritarian” ideologies took root.They concluded that the answer, as sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset phrased it in an influential 1959article, lay in the white working class, whose members exhibited “greater suggestibility” and an “inability to take a complex view,” among other character flaws. Sometimes it was unclear exactly who Lipset was referring to. Manual laborers? People with low levels of education? People with low incomes? Such specifics hardly seemed to matter, though, given the seductive nature of Lipset’s thesis (which would, in time,comeunderscrutiny, though without much effect on its influence).The idea of “working-class authoritarianism” had profound implications for how liberals thought about the Democratic Party’s base. “The gradual realization that extremist and intolerant movements in modern society are more likely to be based on the lower classes than on the middle and upper classes,” Lipset noted, “has posed a tragic dilemma for those intellectuals of the democratic left who once believed the proletariat necessarily to be a force for liberty, racial equality, and social progress.” David Riesman and Nathan Glazer went even farther: liberal intellectuals, the sociologistsargued, now had more in common with Wall Street traders than with workers, especially on issues like “civil rights and civil liberties.”For a time, the question of “working-class authoritarianism” seemed irrelevant to anyone beyond a small subset of academics and pundits. The Democratic Party captured the White House in 1960 and 1964 — the latter by landslide margins — with working-class whites at the core of its coalition. But Democrats’ 1966 midterm losses and Hubert Humphrey’s defeat in the 1968 presidential contest thrust the white working class into the center of the political discussion.When signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Lyndon Johnsonsupposedlyproclaimedthat the Democrats would lose the South for a generation. The 1966 and 1968 elections seemed to prove Johnson’s apocryphal prediction correct. Southern whites withbigoted views on racefledthe Democratic Party,creatinga corresponding drop in Democrats’ overall share of working-class whites. But as Schickler and other scholars have noted, the Civil Rights Act was less a sudden disjuncture than the culmination of a slow-moving realignment that had begun during the New Deal.In fact, focusing on the Civil Rights Act’s role in transforming the Democratic coalition obscures deeper, decades-long political and economic trends in the South. Long before the 1960s, GOP leaders had begun to water down the party’s Reconstruction-era commitment to racial equality by assuring Southerners that the party would not, in the words ofPresident William Howard Taft, “interfere with the regulation by the Southern States of their domestic affairs” — a shift that helped theGOPwin elections in the region beginning in the 1920s and startdrawingSouthern whites away from Democrats in national presidential elections followingFDR’s landslide 1932 victory. The Republican Party’s growing attention to the South continued through the 1950s, when President Dwight Eisenhowerinvestedheavily in theGOP’s party infrastructure in Southern states, fostering increasing competitiveness in a once-solidly-Democratic region.Paradoxically, the New Deal’s fiscal largesse had also fueled economic conservatism’s slow ascent in the South.FDR’s conscious efforts to develop the region catalyzed the South’s economic shift from “Cotton Belt to Sunbelt,” and the bipartisan commitment to Cold War defense spending further stoked the South’s economy throughout the post–World War II era.With the Southern economy humming along, its political leaders worked to create a low-tax, union-free, pro-business environment — enabling states to poach businesses from the Northeast and Midwest andsetting offan economic race to the bottom that ultimately resulted inoutsourcing andoffshoring.For postwar “New South” politicos, the goal was to replace the South’s image as a racist backwater with a Sunbelt branding that stressed the region’s dynamic, high-tech economy. The middle- and upper-middle-class whites that inhabited the region’s fast-growing suburbs — many of them transplants from other regions — likewise rejected the overt racism associated with the old South. They instead embraced, historian Matt Lassiterwrites, a “discourse of suburban innocence that depicted residential segregating as the class-based outcome of meritocratic individualism.”In other words, the GOP’sultimate triumphin the South was, in many ways, theproductof economic development andsuburbanization.Paradoxically, the New Deal’s fiscal largesse had also fueled economic conservatism’s slow ascent in the South.A view of the Dallas skyline from a penthouse apartment in 1952. Huntington LibraryWhile Southern whites had slowly been moving to the GOP for decades, the party’s biggest advances in the region frequently came in Sunbelt suburbs — not the Deep South — during the 1960s and ’70s. In addition, asnumerousstudieshavefound, well-off whites’ shift away from the Democratic Party in the South was more pronounced than their working-class counterparts.Unfortunately, the most influential contemporary analysis of the GOP’s Southern inroads directed its attention elsewhere. Republican strategist Kevin Phillips’sThe Emerging Republican Majority, published in 1969, argued that the white working class could be united with the existing GOP base to form a durable Republican coalition.Formerly Democratic white workers, Phillipswrote, had been “elevated by prosperity to middle-class status and conservatism.” As a result of this supposed embourgeoisement, Phillips argued, the GOP no longer needed to worry that Democrats could win working-class whites with populist economic appeals. “In the future,” he predicted, “the liberal-conservative division will come on social issues.” The GOP could create a robust majority simply by fomenting racial and cultural backlash.WhileThe Emerging Republican Majoritywas less novel than it seemed — liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger had written two years earlier that “[t]he issues are no longer social or economic so much as they are cultural and moral” — the Nixon White House “devoured and relished” the book, according to reporters Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. Phillips’s blueprint came to be known as the “Southern Strategy” (one of the mostwidelyused, and widelymisunderstood, concepts in American history, which has been elevated to a catchall explanation for the Democratic Party’s post-1960s electoral downfall).Taken in by the simplicity of Phillips’s ideas — which, interestingly enough, had originated in case studies of elections in Northern cities — the Nixon administration put them into full effect in the 1970 midterms.With “the most vigorous ideological campaign of any President of this century,” the columnist James Restonwrote, the White House enthusiastically backed hard-right candidates in congressional and gubernatorial races across the country. Stumping for favored GOP hopefuls, Nixon spotlighted the racially tinged issues of risingcrime, high taxes, andwelfare, while Vice President Spiro Agnew — the closest thing the GOP had to the arch-segregationist George Wallace —denouncedDemocrats’ “pusillanimous pussyfooting on the critical issue of law and order” at every opportunity.Though he didn’t say so publicly, Nixon had his doubts about Philips’s thesis. He understood that the GOP’s economic program had little to offer voters in “blue collar suburbs.” The GOP needed to “get above the material things,” Nixon explained. “If they’re thinking economics, we lose.”Unfortunately for Nixon, white working-class voters were “thinking economics” in 1970. Inflation was running at more than 5 percent. Unemployment was rising. And the GOP did lose them. The white working class broke for the Democrats, often in higher margins than in 1966 or 1968. Though Nixon bristled publicly at the press’s portrayal of the midterms as a loss for the GOP and a failure for the Phillips strategy, privately he agreed.Within weeks of the election, Nixon embraced a new understanding of what moved working-class voters. Back in the summer of 1970, Jerome Rosow, an assistant secretary of labor, had delivered him a fifteen-pagereporton “The Problem of the Blue-Collar Worker.” Rosow’s ideas had received little attention in the run-up to the midterms, largely because they almost wholly contradicted Phillips’s thesis. Now Nixon was ready to listen.Rosow placed the concrete economic and social concerns of all workers, not just white workers, at the heart of his analysis. The working class was not comfortable and prosperous, as the “working-class authoritarianism” thesis claimed. The 40 percent of families making between $5,000 and $10,000 per year — which included not only blue-collar workers, but also those in low-paying white-collar service jobs — were facing an “economic squeeze . . . related to wage, tax and government benefit structure for the nonpoor.”While Rosow agreed that white workers harbored racial hostility, he attributed it to low levels of education and competition within the working class for scarce economic resources. Rather than foment these bigotries in order to divide workers along racial lines, Rosow recommended that Nixon pursue an array of government spending measures directed at the entire working class, including subsidized child care and housing, expanded disability insurance, educational assistance, and federal relief for rising state and local taxes.Conservatives fumed. They slammed Rosow’s proposals and encouraged Nixon to double down on the race-baiting the administration had deployed in the midterms. But Nixon dissented, instead proposing a plan to build a “New Majority” that would unite the traditionally Democratic urban white working class and the traditionally Republican suburban white middle class.In order to court suburban moderates, Nixon re-embraced the “color-blind conservatism” that he had deployed in the 1968 campaign, when Wallace’s segregationist candidacy had made capturing the right flank impossible. Nixon now understood that while suburbanites may have opposed policies like busing for integration, they also rejected the hard-right rhetoric of the 1970 midterms.To win the working-class whites who’d been “thinking economics” in the 1970 midterms, Nixon pushed his tax and spending policies to the left. He pursued substantialfiscalandmonetarystimulus. He signed notonebuttwosignificant expansions of Social Security, including disability insurance, into law. He enacted Revenue Sharing, which hepitchedas a way to reduce regressive state and local taxes, and promised direct federal relief from property taxes, which hedenouncedfor levying an “unfair and heavy burden on the poor, the elderly, the wage earner, the farmer, and those on fixed incomes.”As Nixon’s top domestic adviser, John Ehrlichman,admittedto the press, “The essence of this is redistribution.” Nixon also shocked the country byinstitutingwage and price controls, an anti-inflation tool favored by liberal Democrats and staunchly opposed by Republicans.While Nixon was busy burnishing his reelection credentials, the battle for the 1972 Democratic nomination was exposing fault lines in the party’s approach to the white working class and, relatedly, Democrats’ understanding of their party’s ideal electoral coalition.George McGovern’s successful long-shot campaign drew press attention for its appeals to antiwar youth. To many observers, McGovern’s campaign resembled Eugene McCarthy’s ill-fated 1968 primary challenge to Lyndon Johnson. McCarthy had little use for the white working class — and, in manycases, poor and working-class African Americans — insteaddrawingmost of his support from white upper-middle-class professional and college students.Events like 1970’s “hard hat riot,” thoughnotrepresentative of all white workers, seemed to confirm for many liberals both the wisdom of McCarthy’s political calculation and the validity of the “working-class authoritarianism” thesis. New Left radicals also largely abandoned the working class as a “revolutionary subject,”elevating in its placecollege students and people of color.Undoubtedly, McGovern’s antiwar stance and social liberalism attracted not only legions of college students but alsomanyof the middle-class white liberals who had turned out for McCarthy. One of McGovern’s advisers, Frederick Dutton, evenadvanceda Democratic version of the embourgeoisement thesis, predicting that expanding prosperity would soon raise the enlightened lifestyle concerns of college students and well-off suburban whites above the material concerns — and supposed social backwardness — of the white working class. (Contrary to Dutton’s predictions, McGovern’s overall performance in the general election among college-educated whites would be identical to Humphrey’s in 1968.)But despite the attention paid to McGovern’s educated supporters, the South Dakota senator’s campaign was more reminiscent of Robert F. Kennedy’sattemptin the 1968 primaries to unite people of color with working-class whites than to McCarthy’s quixotic campaign. Indeed, McGovern’s approach to the white working class was crucial to his success — a fact not lost on the Nixon campaign.McGovern sought to channel the ire of the broader working class at ‘the richer, corporations, and Republicans in power.’George McGovern in 1972. Library of Congress“Only two smart campaigns emerge, Wallace and McGovern,” a Committee to Reelect the President memo analyzing the Democratic primary field noted. Yet whereas Wallace encouraged white workers to direct their anger at (presumably black) “welfare loafers,” McGovern sought to channel the ire of the broader working class at “the richer, corporations, and Republicans in power.”This “class appeal,” the Nixon campaign memo concluded, was “bad for Republicans.” It proposed higher taxes on the rich, tax relief for the poor and working class, and generous universal social provisions, including a universal basic income and single-payer health insurance.McGovern’s fellow Democratic candidates were more likely to follow Wallace’s lead in appealing to the white working class, however. Even liberal stalwart and erstwhile civil rights champion Hubert Humphrey resorted to race-baiting in the 1972 primaries, with one of his radio adsdeclaring, in Wallace-esque terms, “Humphrey will stop the flow of your tax dollars to lazy welfare chiselers.” The party mainstream, in other words, saw Wallace’s racist pandering, not McGovern’s interracial populism, as the key to winning the white working class.By November, the economy was booming and the Vietnam War was winding down. No Democratic candidate — moderate, liberal, leftist — stood a chance of defeating Nixon, as econometric political sciencemodelsmadeclear. McGovern lost in a landslide.But however inevitable, McGovern’s loss would be taken up as a cudgel, and profoundly reshape the Democratic Party’s relationship with the working class.The Birth of the Neoliberal Southern StrategyMcGovern’s defeat created an opening for conservatives and moderates in the Democratic Party. Philosophically opposed to both McGovern’s social liberalism and economic populism, these neoliberal “New Democrats” used the South Dakota senator’s crushing loss as an opportunity to try to banish both from the party.The neoliberals called for acompletereorientationof the party’s relationship to the white working class and people of color. Since the Roosevelt era, liberal Democrats had pieced together their coalition by pairing soft social-democratic economics, which appealed to workers across the board, with support for civil rights, which solidified blacks’ loyalty to the party. But the neoliberals saw this “New Deal ethic” as an albatross.Rather than targeting working-class whites, they insisted, the party should cater to well-off white professionals. Their prescription: adopt a program of economic and social moderation, not redistribution, as the solution to inequality — be it economic, racial, gender, or sexual.This strategy had little to offer most African Americans. But the neoliberals assumed that Democrats couldignoreblacks’ substantive concerns and still win their votes in large numbers simply by virtue of not being the GOP. Blacks were, in political scientist Paul Frymer’s phrase, “electorally captured.”The pitch to pivot toward well-off whites came just as the working class needed even greater assistance. While poor and working-class people had seen great economic gains in the decades after World War II, more than half of American families in the late 1960s and early 1970s still fell below what the Bureau of Labor Statistics considered an “intermediatebudget” for a family of four, while nearly one-third fell below its “lower budget.” The rising tide of prosperity had not lifted most Americans’ boats, despite liberals’ declarations to the contrary.As the United Auto Workers notedacerbically, even the “intermediate” BLS budget assumed that a family’s toaster would last for thirty-three years and its vacuum cleaner fourteen years, that the parents in the four-person family would go to the movies once every three months, and that they would have no money for savings.Not only had the working class not become bourgeois during the post–World War II years, the income growth they’d generally seen between the New Deal and the Nixon administration was coming to an end. Income inequality once againbeganto march upward in the late 1960s, before eventuallyexplodingin the 1980s. The early 1970s would also usher indecadesofnearlystagnantwagesformostAmericans. For the more than seven in ten Americanswithouta college degree, the effect was particularly dramatic: incomes for high school–educated workersbeganfallinginrealterms.Escalating inequality unfolded against the backdrop of a larger crisis for the “growth liberalism” that had dominated economic policymaking. The 1970s would be an era of “stagflation,” a combination of high unemployment and high inflation that policymakers had previously thought impossible. More Americans found themselves out of work in the mid-1970s than at any time since the end of World War II, while inflation eroded the incomes of poor and working-class Americans atgreaterrates than those of the rich.Government fiscal policy exacerbated this growing pocketbooksqueeze. Between the mid-1950s and mid-1970s, taxes rosemuchmorefor lower- and middle-income Americans than for the well-off, who actually saw their tax burden fall.Some on the Left understood that the promises of postwar liberalism hadn’t translated into economic security for most Americans. In a 1972issueofDissentdedicated to blue-collar workers, socialist intellectual Michael Harrington dispelled the myth that the working class “no longer exists in America.” Many politicians and commentators, Harrington wrote, had been misled by the relative shift from blue-collar to white-collar work in the US economy. Most of these new white-collar jobs, he argued, were no guarantee of prosperity. Blue-collar or white-collar, this working class was bound together by one common experience: “it does not have enough money.”Harrington wasn’t alone in challenging the emerging consensus. In 1974’sThe Working Class Majority, Andrew Levison argued that the white working class was at once less prosperous and less reactionary than many pundits believed. But if it lacked resources, the working class was also becoming more diverse — necessitating a renewed attention to workers of all races.An autoworker on the assembly line in the 1970s.Left-liberal activists like Saul Alinsky and George Wiley and progressive organizations like Public Citizen and ACORN joined the cause inturningto the needs of the multiracial working and middle classes. But theircallsfor more robust solutions to poverty and inequality fell on deaf ears in a rightward-moving Democratic Party.The proto-“supply side” austerity of Jimmy Carter’s one-term presidency struck many of the chords that would soon compose the neoliberals’ siren song. Carterresistedcalls from the reenergized grassrootslabor-leftto focus on unemployment and inequality, rather than inflation, and rejected both FDR’s New Deal and Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society liberalism.“Government cannot solve our problems, it can’t set our goals, it cannot define our vision,” Carter declared in his 1978 State of the Unionaddress. “Government cannot eliminate poverty or provide a bountiful economy or reduce inflation or save our cities or cure illiteracy or provide energy.”Carter’s economic conservatism had a corrosive effect on the Democratic Party’s base. In four short years, support from working-class whites dropped yet again. According to a team of sociologists led by Lane Kenworthy, the impetuswaseconomic stagnation — a “growing share of working-class whites lost confidence in the Democrats’ ability to deliver the goods on key material issues.” Their declining prospects created an opening for “Ronald Reagan’s simple and sharply contrasting strategy for managing the economy.” (The importance of economic rather than cultural or racial issues in Democrats’ falling support in recent decades is echoed in the work of other scholars, who’vefoundthat upper-income whites attach greater significance to cultural issues than their working-class counterparts.)Even worse, once Democrats lost their advantage on the economy with these voters, they never regained it: younger generations of white workers with no loyalty to the party replaced older ones for whom the image of the Democratic Party as the party of working-class prosperity was a living memory.But neoliberal Democrats were in denial. Despite Carter’s support for inflation-fightingausterity,a supply-side tax cut, andbusiness–friendlyfiscal responsibility, they cast Carter’s loss to Reagan as a loss for the Left, just as they would whenever a Democrat, no matter how centrist, was beaten in the years to come.The Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) played a particularly important role in disseminating this kind of spin. Founded in 1985, the DLC used money from corporations like Morgan Stanley, Dow Chemical, Citigroup, and Koch Industries to swing the party decisively to the right.The DLC’s most coveted voters were upscale, suburban white moderates. In order to woo this demographic, the DLC urged the party todedicateitself to “consensual” rather than “conflictual” values, which largely meant shifting to the right on both economic and racial issues and trading a commitment to equality for a commitment to “opportunity.” Virginia governor Chuck Robb, one of the DLC’s founders,saidthe DLC’s goal was tomakethe Democrats the “party of change, the party of economic opportunity and growth, the party of strength and resolve and willingness to defend basic American values and freedom, and hopefully . . . the party of fiscal responsibility.”In 1988, the DLC helpedengineera “Super Tuesday” of Southern states, hoping it would boost New Democrat Al Gore. Instead, it aided civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, a bête noire ofneoliberalDemocrats. “I would say this to Jesse Jackson,” Gary HarttoldtheAtlantic Monthlyin 1988. “’Jesse, what are your policies? More of the same? More maintenance? More handouts?’” What the party needed, Hart explained, wasn’t Jackson’s “Rainbow Coalition,” but to become “more market-oriented in economics” and to ignore the demands of “special interests” like labor, African Americans, feminists, and the poor.The New Democrats rallied around Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, a moderate technocrat who embodied the party’s post-McGovern shift, as the responsible alternative to Jackson. Dukakis’spitchto the nation at the Democratic National Convention emphasized “competence” and eschewed “ideology.” It specifically avoided discussions of racism or class and instead stressed “old-fashioned values like accountability and responsibility.” Only after Dukakis’s loss to George H. W. Bush did the centrists who had championed himlabelDukakis a lefty.Though it didn’t prevent the Democrats from losing three consecutive presidential races, the New Democrats’ targeting of upscale whites did begin to pay off. Throughout the 1980s, Democratic presidential candidates performed almostequallywell among college and non-college whites, a key first step in what Ronald Brownstein hasdubbeda “class inversion” of the parties among white voters.Doubling down on this inversion, the New Democrats believed, was the path to victory — no matter the costs to unions, the poor, or African Americans.Clintonism’s RiseAfter Dukakis’s drubbing in 1988, the neoliberals called for Democrats to move even further to the right.In the DLC’s post-1988report, strategists William Galston and Elaine Kamarck insisted that the Democrats should distance themselves from the language of New Deal liberalism and embrace “middle-class values” like “individual responsibility, hard work, [and] equal opportunity.”The DLC’s leaders increasingly pinned their electoral hopes on Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, who became the Council’s chair in 1990. Clinton’stakeawayfrom Dukakis’s loss was as misguided as it was DLC friendly: “If we lead with class warfare, we lose.”In 1992, Clinton carried the pro-business centrism that hadsuffusedhis governorship onto the presidential campaign trail. Traditional left-liberal concerns — such as economic inequality, poverty, and racial segregation — received short shrift. He explained issues of inequality in terms of individual skills and education, not policy or political power.“[W]hat you earn depends on what you learn,” Clinton and his vice presidential nominee, Al Gore,proclaimedin their campaign book. The solution to stagnant incomes, they argued, wasn’t robust government intervention, but creating “the best educated, best-trained workforce in the world.” They had little use for unions and eagerly supported “free trade” agreements. “We believe in free enterprise and the power of market forces,” they wrote.According to Clinton, there was little that stoking the growth of the postindustrial “New Economy” couldn’t solve. As he proclaimed in his 1992 DNC acceptancespeech, “The most important family policy, urban policy, labor policy, minority policy, and foreign policy America can have is an expanding, entrepreneurial economy of high-skill, high-wage jobs.”With his deep-rooted faith in high-tech entrepreneurialism, Clinton differed little from Dukakis. But Clinton added a crucial element: arightward turnon race. Years later, DLC acolytes woulddenyand downplay the role of racism in Clinton’s 1992 campaign. But its centrality to Clinton and the New Democrats was undeniable. As Franklin Foeradmittedin a sympathetic account, “More than any issue, race defined the rise of the New Democrats in the 1980s.”Clinton didn’t just take black voters for granted. He pointedly used African Americans as a foil to demonstrate that Democrats had abandoned racial liberalism. He snubbed Jesse Jackson, denouncedSister Souljah,executedRicky Ray Rector, and adopted punitive, racialized stances onwelfareandcriminal justice.In part, Clinton’s racial posturing was aimed at winning back working-class whites. After all, if non-college whites were to the left of the party on economic issues and to the right of the party on social issues, the New Democrats knew which way they preferred to move. But the lurch to the right on race was also designed to help Clintonwin over“white, mainly suburban, mostly middle-class voters,” who were intolerant of anything beyond an empty commitment to “equal opportunity” for African Americans.Clinton didn’t just take black voters for granted. He pointedly used African Americans as a foil to demonstrate that Democrats had abandoned racial liberalism.Bill Clinton in 1993. Library of CongressIn some ways, Clinton’s gambit succeeded. The Arkansas governor equaled Dukakis’s percentages among every group of white voters except whites with some college (among whom Clinton ran six points ahead of Dukakis). But because 1992 was a three-way race (with Texas billionaire Ross Perot finishing in a strong third behind George H. W. Bush), Clinton performed better than Dukakis as a share of the two-party vote.Still, Clinton’s ostensibly resounding win overshadowed some troubling trends. “Clinton’s ratings are about as high among affluent, educated, managers as among less-educated blue collar Americans,”Los Angeles Timespollster John Brennannoted. “Younger blue-collar males — a particularly pessimistic lot these days — remain doubtful about Clinton.” Nor were blue-collar whites the only group uncertain about Clinton.Despite New Democrats’ conviction that they could tack right on racial issues without losing African-American voters, the 1992 Democratic primariessaw“the smallest black voter turnout for a presidential primary in a decade.” In many key states, Clinton won less than half the number of African-American votes that Jesse Jackson had received during his losing campaign four years earlier. Lack of black enthusiasm for Clinton continued into the general election, both in terms ofturnoutand voteshare.But the New Democrats claimed that Clinton’s victory proved that economic and cultural centrism worked. (In truth, the force that propelled Clinton over the finish line in 1992 was Americans’skittishnessaboutthe economy.)Once in office, Clinton did little to reassure Americans uneasy about their material standing. In fact, to many members of the party’s traditional voting base, his actions had the opposite effect. Brushing aside the objections of unions and many congressional Democrats, Clintonsuccessfully advancedBush’s North American Free Trade Agreement.“Few issues in American life have produced a class schism like NAFTA,” Hart Research’s Guy Molyneuxobservedin early 1994. “People in blue-collar households, with moderate incomes, and without a college degree were all strongly opposed to the treaty. On the other side were those earning over $50,000 and four year college graduates.” In a prescient aside, Molyneux warned that blue-collar workers would hold Democrats accountable in the decades to come if it became clear that trade had cost them their jobs.By the end of his first term, Clinton was declaring that “the era of big government is over,” and that Americans were entering “the era of balanced budgets and smaller government.” Welfare was also on the chopping block.Since the program’s inception, conservatives had yearned to eliminate cash assistance to the needy (officially called Aid to Families with Dependent Children). Neither Reagan nor Bush had been able to achieve that goal. But Clinton made it a priority. Early in his reelection year, Clinton sided with Republicans against most congressional Democrats (and a fewmembersof his own administration) to “end welfare as we know it,” a policy shift thatincreaseddeeppovertyand left many of the most marginalized with nowhere to turn.This didn’t much trouble Clinton, however. Neither the blue-collar workers opposed to NAFTA nor the poor Americans hurt by welfare reform were in his targeted demographic. Instead, Clinton’s reelection campaign focused on a group of upscale white women dubbed “soccer moms.”While Clinton hadlostwhite married suburban women to Bush by nearly a two-to-one margin in 1992, polls in 1996 showed Clinton edging Dole among this group. Suddenly, the “soccer mom” vote assumed an outsized role in the imagination of Clinton strategists. The problem was, they weren’t really Democratic voters.“What makes the soccer moms so key this time is that they are voting Republican for Congress and Democratic for President,” Democratic pollster Celinda Lakeexplained. Clinton’s strategy, in other words, revolved around courting voters that would help him secure reelection, but wouldn’t provide him with the Democratic congressional majority necessary (if insufficient) to enact progressive policies. (Lake, for her part, believed Clinton should target “waitress moms” — blue-collar women who were a more traditional Democratic constituency.)On Election Day, Clinton defeated Bob Dole with hugegainsin the suburbs and among college-educated women. Yet, as Lake predicted, “soccer moms”tendedto split their tickets, pulling the lever for Clinton for president and Republicans for Congress.Not that many Clinton allies minded. New Democrats, onereportnoted, could “hardly hide their glee” that the Democrats failed to retake the House, because it meant that Clinton would have cover to reach across the aisle and make a deal on entitlement programs.After Clinton’s reelection, the DLC pushed him, in From’swords, to pursue a “fundamental restructuring of our biggest systems for delivering public benefits — Medicare, Social Security, and public education, for openers.” For New Democrats, that meant “marketplace” solutions and a “grand bargain” with Republicans that traded higher minimum Social Security benefits for partial privatization, “promot[ing] individual wealth creation and broader ownership.”“The grand bargain sketched here . . . would convert Social Security from an entitlement based on the false promise that everyone can consume more than they produce to a system that promotes savings, investment, and greater economic self-reliance,” Will Marshall, the then-president of the DLC-affiliated Progressive Policy Institute,wrote. “And it would embody a new approach to governing based on a key New Democrat insight: That in the Information Age, government’s role is not to take care of us, but to give us the tools we need to take care of ourselves and each other.”In late 1997, Clinton met secretly with House GOP leader Newt Gingrich and Ways and Means chair Bill Archer to hammer out a plan to partially privatize Social Security. “I’m prepared to take the political heat to provide political cover for the Republicans,” ClintonassuredArcher. The outlines of the deal included a hike in the retirement age and the diversion of a portion of payroll tax dollars into private accounts.In exchange for dismantling the greatest Democratic policy achievement of the twentieth century, virtually all Clinton wanted was a promise that the GOP wouldn’t try to use the projected budget surplus for tax cuts.Clinton and Gingrich planned to announce their Social Security privatization deal in 1998. Then the two would turn to overhauling Medicare. The president’s strategy was to ignore the protests of more progressive Democrats and assemble a coalition of Republicans and conservative New Democrats and Blue Dog Democrats to pass entitlement reform.Only the Monica Lewinsky scandal saved what remained of the American welfare state from Clinton and Gingrich’s clutches.The White-Collar Strategy Gains Steam — and Runs AgroundReflecting on the results of the 1996 campaign, Democratic strategistscouldn’t agreewhy Clinton had prevailed.The DLC claimed that Clinton’s centrist stances on the budget, welfare, and crime had garnered him the votes of upscale, college-educated whites. But former Clinton pollster Stanley Greenberg argued that Clinton won because working- and middle-class voters believed (incorrectly, as it turned out) that he would pursue traditional Democratic domestic priorities, including defending Medicare and Social Security.In some sense, the debate was academic. The dot-com boom lifted the economy, making Clinton a shoo-in for reelection, even if he didn’t exactly inspire enthusiasm. (Turnout in 1996 was the lowestsince1924, with less than half of eligible Americans casting a ballot.) But the discussion was of enormous importance for charting the party’s path forward.Clinton’s success emboldened New Democrats in their declarations that the party’s future lay with well-off whites. “Just as industrial workers formed the backbone of the New Deal coalition, the party needs to attract the knowledge workers who are emerging as the dominant force in the information economy,” Marshallwrotein 1997. “Liberal elites,” he claimed, were the only ones who supported “economic populism.”Likewise, Clinton pollster Mark Pennarguedthat the president’s reelection proved that blue-collar whites were now irrelevant to the Democratic Party. Attempts to appeal to the working class, he claimed, would pull the Democrats back into making a “losing class-warfare argument.”More progressive Democratic strategists pointed to warning signs obscured by Clinton’s victory. “Noncollege-educated voters in particular are deeply concerned about their ability to afford education for their children, to pay for health care, and to provide for their retirement,” Greenbergwrote. “They strongly support measures designed to hold corporations accountable and are markedly skeptical of the value of free trade agreements.” The DLC’s “elite centrist agenda” of balanced budgets and entitlement cuts, he warned, held little appeal for these voters.Clinton’s policies not only disproportionately harmed the poor and people of color — they didn’t even secure the loyalties of working-class whites. Democrats experiencedanotherdrop in support among white workers during the mid-1990s, likely as result ofNAFTAandotherClinton economic policies as well as the cultural conservatism of working-class white men.Ultimately, Clinton’s sole claim to lionization by the New Democrats came from his electoral victories and the relatively rapid economic growth of the late 1990s. However, asFiveThirtyEight’s Ben Casselman hasargued, most of the things that boosted the economy, from the rise of the Internet to the entry of the Baby Boomers into their peak earning years, had little to do with Clinton’s policies. And in gutting welfare, signing NAFTA, cutting capital gains taxes, and deregulating Wall Street, Clinton’s policies did tremendous harm to the poor and working class while helping set the stage for the financial crisis that gave us the Great Recession.“The president might not be able to conjure GDP growth out of thin air,” theAtlantic’s Derek Thompson haswritten. “But he (or she) can shape how the winnings are distributed.” Under Clinton, that distribution was upward. The Gini coefficientgrewthroughout the 1990s as the incomes of the very richestshot up.The New Democrats parried criticisms that they had abandoned the poor and working class or stoked inequality by formulating a 1990s version of the embourgeoisement thesis. In the inaugural issue of the DLC’sBlueprint Magazine, Galston and Kamarck painted a sunny picture of an American economy where “millions of Americans are surging into the ranks of the upper middle class and wealthy.”“We can discern the rise of a new learning class of workers who will dominate at least the first half of the 21st century,” Galston and Kamarck wrote. “They will be better educated, more affluent, more mobile, and more self-reliant. . . . Their political outlook and behavior will increasingly defy the class-based divisions of the old economy, and they will be increasingly skeptical of centralized, one-size-fits-all solutions.”The DLC’s founder, Al From, echoed this diagnosis. “The sharp class differences of the Industrial Age are becoming less distinct as more and more Americans move into the middle and upper-middle classes,” heargued. The Democrats should therefore give up targeting either people of color or the white working class — to say nothing of the poor — and instead go after the “affluent, educated, diverse, suburban, ‘wired,’ and moderate” members of the “rising learning class” (who also happened to be overwhelmingly white).An office in the 1990s.The DLCencouragedDemocrats to distance themselves from “special interests” and “intermediaries”: unions and organizations that represented “identity group politics,” which they equated with “separatist claims based on race, ethnicity or gender.” Anything that distracted from the New Democrats’ favored audience of well-off, fiscally conservative whites was verboten.The DLC also dismissed claims that income inequality was “the fly in the New Economy ointment.” Inequality, economists at the DLC’s think tankinsisted, had been overblown by their left critics and would “begin shrinking” soon. The only answer to inequality, they concluded, was a continued fidelity to “fiscal discipline, global competition, flexible labor markets, transparent capital markets, deregulated businesses, rapid communications, and limited government interference in markets.”A triumphalist — and, likemuchof his work, artfully misleading — 1998reportby Penn claimed that Americans were fundamentally optimistic about the “New Economy.” Penn’s survey showed that those he dubbed “wired workers” were particularly enthusiastic, while lower-income workers, blue-collar workers, younger workers, and black workers were the most pessimistic.That those most concerned about the “New Economy” represented the Democrats’ traditional voting base didn’t temper Penn’s enthusiasm — nor did thefact(omitted from Penn’s write-up) that the most common response to the open-ended question “What does the term ‘New Economy’ mean to you?” was that it was a meaningless “buzzword.”By 2000, “socially liberal and fiscally conservative” “wiredworkers” were Democrats’ hot new demographic target. “Everything that a strategist does — everything that I do as a strategist — is focused on suburban voters,” Democratic pollster Doug SchoentoldtheNew York Times.The strategy of the Republican nominee that year, Texas governor George W. Bush, was based on running against Clinton’s personal foibles and blurring the lines between Democratic nominee Al Gore’s Clintonesque centrism and Bush’s own “compassionate conservatism.” It was an argument that voters could be forgiven for believing, considering Clinton had spent the 1990s attempting to elide the differences between his party and the GOP. With seemingly few major policy distinctions, many voters viewed the race as little more than apersonalitycontest, and Gore trailed Bush throughout the summer.In a desperate attempt to avert defeat, Gore made a late-campaign foray into “mild–mannered”economicpopulism, beginning with his conventionspeech. The goal, Gore’s pollsterexplained, was to make Bush the “candidate of the wealthy and most privileged, who would potentially endanger Social Security, [and] oppose a woman’s right to choose.” The populist turn worked, bringingGorewithinstrikingdistanceof Bush.But New Democrats were apoplectic.“A redistributionist appeal doesn’t work anymore,” Fromfumed. “This is a different country. Attacking oil companies and pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies will not win elections, I guarantee you.” Gore’s populism, the DLCers warned, risked alienating the well-off whites that they had worked so hard to attract. “Once you have a class warfare message, you can’t appeal to the upper middle class,” an unnamed Clinton White House strategisttoldtheDaily News. “Democrats have to be the party of the new economy.” Neoliberal journalists likeMickey Kaus,Michael Kinsley, Mort Zuckerman, and Joe Kleinjoinedconservativepundits like George Will and Peggy Noonan in panning Gore’s populist turn.When Gore lost the Electoral College vote, DLCacolytesblamedGore’spopulism, however tepid, for his defeat. “Gore chose a populist rather than a New Democrat message,” Frommaintained. “As a result, voters viewed him as too liberal and identified him as an advocate of big government. Those perceptions, whether fair or not, hurt him with male voters in general and with key New Economy swing voters in particular. By emphasizing class warfare he seemed to be talking to Industrial Age America, not Information Age America.”However, contra From, the pollsmadeclearthat Gore’s eleventh-hour populism had staved off defeat in the popular vote by energizing the Democratic base andwinningbacksome downscale whites — allwithoutperformingworsethan Clinton had among the DLC’s prized upscale demographic. In fact, many Bush voterspreferredGore’s economic message, but voted against him because they disliked him personally or associated him with Clinton’s scandals. (The number one reason Bush voters cited for their choice: “restoring honor and dignity to the White House.”)Gore’s Electoral College loss wasn’t the only bad news for Democrats. After eight years of Clintonism, Democrats had fallen to fifty-year lows in both the US House and Senate, dropped below twenty governorships for the first time since 1970, and controlled the fewest number of state legislatures in fifty years. “The Clinton years have, in effect, equalized the strength of the two parties,” Bill Schneidernotedin theAtlanticin early 2001. “Under Clinton the Republicans made gains unmatched even during the Reagan era — and they held on to them.”Yet, thanks to the influence of the DLC, the neoliberals’ view of Gore’s loss as a loss for populism largely carried the day.In 2004, the New Democrats got what they wanted. The party nominated John Kerry. Al Frompredictedthat the Massachusetts senator’s military service and message of fiscal responsibility would both energize Democrats and win over the DLC’s coveted “moderate Republicans” and “swing voters.”“By choosing Kerry in the primaries, Democrats made an affirmative decision to continue that change and to build on the New Democrat foundation of Clintonism,” Fromwrotein July. Kerry, he continued, “stands for economic growth and opportunity, not redistribution; for expanding the middle class, not the middle-class tax burden; for national strength, not national weakness; for work, not welfare; for tackling big challenges with reforms; and for an ethic of duty and responsibility.”“Democrats are on the cusp of becoming a majority party today,” Fromgushed, “because New Democrats like Bill Clinton and John Kerry rescued the party in the 1990s.”From couldn’t have been more wrong. Bush increased his margin of victory from 2000across virtually every demographic, including women, college-educated voters, moderates, and independents. And Democrats lost four Senate seats and three House seats, giving the GOP a majority in both chambers.How had the GOP topped a DLC-approved Democrat once again? By executing a game plan that bore little resemblance to the DLC’s.Republican strategist and Bush adviser Karl Rove expected 2004 to be a close race. But rather than encourage Bush and GOP candidates to tack to the center, he applied insights from a 2001articleby conservative pundit Michael Barone, who argued that America was essentially a 50-50 country, with few truly persuadable voters. Following Barone’s thesis, Rovefocusedon turning out the Republicanbase, not only by having Bush play to dedicated GOP voters, but also by ensuring anti–gay marriage referenda wouldappearon the ballot in key states.“While John Kerry’s campaign has made an extraordinary effort to gather moderate voters to his liberal base by stressing its candidate’s decorated war record and centrist views,” theAtlanticexplained, “Rove . . . has returned to his traditional strength: motivating the base of conservative voters.”The DLC’s analysis of Kerry’s loss, meanwhile, was utterlypredictable. In direct contradiction to From’s previous writings, the DLC now blamed the party’s 2004 defeats on Democrats’ failure to “buildon Clintonism.” In a series of articles in the DLC’sBlueprint Magazine, the organization called for the party to further distance itself from cultural liberalism, military dovishness, and economic populism. The path forward on cultural issues, according to Marshall, was “values centrism,” which seemed to amount to little more than a further rightward tack on “family values” issues likeabortionandanotherattempt to trim Social Security.So shopworn and unpersuasive were the DLC’s arguments that even many mainstream pundits were beginning to question the New Democrats’ fundamental theses.Following Democrats’ 2004 losses, Chuck Toddarguedit was time for Democrats to retire “Clinton’s strategy of centrist triangulation.” While Clinton may have won in 1992, he noted, the Clintonite strategy had proven “disastrous” for the Democratic Party as a whole. “Clinton worried mainly about his own political fortunes, to the detriment of his party,” Todd wrote, adding that “perhaps the most remarkable statistic from the 2004 election is the record of those candidates for whom Clinton campaigned: all eight lost.”After back-to-back defeats at the presidential level, some Democrats began taking their first, tentative steps away from tepid centrism. With the Iraq War (which the DLCsupported) a quagmire, incomes stagnating, and inequality soaring, Democrats struck apopulisttonein the 2006midterms.And it paid off.They won the House, the Senate, and a majority of governorships in a “rout once considered almost inconceivable,” as theWashington Postput it. The Democrats madedramatic gainsamong working-class whites, cutting their deficit among the group in half from 2004, andsubstantially increasedtheir margins among Latinos and Asian Americans.By 2008, it seemed that neoliberal centrism was finally reaching its race-baiting end. The DLC had beenpositioningHillary Clinton for a White House bid since before the 2006 midterms. Now she was its preferred candidate, tapping the DLC-approved Penn as her campaignstrategist. But the candidacy of Barack Obama, who hadprominentlyshunnedtheDLC, torpedoed both her campaign’s attempts to make her nomination appear inevitable and the DLC’s coveted coalition of well-off whites.Almost immediately, Obama began pullingcollege-educatedvoters from Clinton, and he easily captured theyouth vote, too. Despite pundit handwringing about whether Obama was “black enough” to peel off African-American votes from the well-known Clinton, he gained ground quickly, andendorsementsfrom prominent black Democrats like John Lewis accelerated African Americans’ exodus from Clinton.Clinton’sonly hopeof besting Obama lay with working-class whites. But she was ill-equipped to make a convincing pocketbook appeal. The Bush years had revealed 1990s-style New Economy utopianism for the cruel joke it always was. Now Clinton was stuck trying toawkwardly and dishonestlydistance herself from NAFTA and other unpopular polices from her husband’s White House. Her initial lead over Obama on economic issuesshrankas the primary wore on.With Clinton hemorrhaging support among African Americans and little in the way of a positive economic message to sell working-class whites, the Clinton campaign decided, as political scientist Thomas F. Schallernoted, “that if they were going to lose the black vote, they might as well turn it into an advantage with other elements in the Democratic coalition, notably white working-class voters.”That meant race-baiting on a scale that would rival her husband’s performance in 1992. Earlier in the campaign, Penn had argued in amemothat Obama’s “lack of American roots” was a “strong weakness.”“I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and values,” Penn wrote, inproto-“birther” language. “Every speech [by Clinton] should contain the line that you were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century.” With Clinton down in the polls, the racial subtext in Penn’s argument became the text.Playing upon rumors that Obama was a secret Muslim, the Clinton campaigncirculateda photo of Obama wearing traditional Somali clothing. Obama’s campaign manager denounced the campaign literature as “shameful offensive fear-mongering.” Butmoreracistappealsfollowed. “Won’t a single tape of [Reverend Jeremiah] Wright going off on America with Obama sitting there be a game ender?” Pennspeculatedin a March memo. Sure enough, tapes of Wright’s sermons found their way into the press’s hands, and Clinton loudlycriticizedObama’s attendance at Wright’s church.Most significantly, the Clinton campaign argued that her strength among working-class whites made her asafer betto beat the Republican nominee in the fall. Stumping for Clinton, Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell warned that downscale whites in his home statewouldn’t votefor a black candidate, putting a key swing state in play for the GOP. And Clinton, dispensing with any campaign trail euphemisms,braggedthat she ran better than Obama “among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans.”Obama’s Campaign Successes and Governing FailuresObama’s identity meant that, almost bynecessity, his 2008 campaign couldn’t replicate the neoliberalism of a Gore or Kerry. While the 2004 DNC speech that put Obama on the political map was a pastiche of the worst centrist bromides, his past as a community organizer and his race meant that the GOP would spend the entire 2008 campaign portraying Obama as asocialistMuslimblack nationalistwho was “palling around with terrorists.” These were the kinds of attacks that DLC types had feared most, but Obama couldn’t escape them.As a result, the Obama campaign put its efforts less into winning over the mythical “soccer moms” or other moderate suburban whites and more into turning out former nonvoters andfirst-timevoters, many of whom were people of color or Millennials.Two strategy stories emerged from Obama’s campaign, and, in time, the perceived importance of each would shape future Democratic campaigns — including Clinton’s ill-fated 2016 run. One gave priority to the door-to-door people power of Obama’sground game. The other credited the role ofbig data.The campaign’s door-to-door organizing philosophy sprung from the Alinsky-inspired theories of sociologist and activistMarshall Ganz, who was known for his work with the United Farmworkers. It involved a massive network of organizers knocking on doors and making personal connections with voters in order to tap into their hopes and their values and, ideally, turn them into Obama supporters.The big data portion of the campaigndrewupon the information collected from door-to-door organizing andcombinedit with information culled from social media and other sources. Crucially, the number-crunching wasn’t a substitute for organizing. The organizing both provided the big-data operation with indispensible information and gave the campaign the bodies needed to put the data-derived insights into action.The onset of the Great Recession meant that the incumbent party had a steep uphill climb in 2008, and the Obama campaign’srelatively populisteconomic messageandstellarget-out-the-vote efforts eliminated any lingering worries that the country’s first black nominee might lose to a popular Republican. Obama defeated John McCain by seven points in the popular vote, improving upon John Kerry’s 2004 margins among virtually everydemographic, includingwhite workers.The Obama campaign put its efforts less into winning over moderate suburban whites and more into turning out former nonvoters and first-time voters.Barack Obama speaks before the Democratic National Convention in August 2008. Carol Highsmith / Library of CongressOnce in office, the biggest issue facing Obama was the Great Recession. Many pundits predicted that he would pursue aNew Dealfor the twenty-first century. Before Obama was even inaugurated,Timedepicted him as FDR on itscover, and liberal writer Peter Beinart speculated, “If [Obama] can do what F.D.R. did — make American capitalism stabler and less savage — he will establish a Democratic majority that dominates U.S. politics for a generation. And despite the daunting problems he inherits, he’s got an excellent chance.”But little in Obama’s background suggested he’d be another FDR (much less the socialist of conservatives’ paranoid dreams). Obamalackeda coherent economic philosophy, and insofar as he had one, it was that of a market-friendly “University of Chicago Democrat.” When the time came to select economic advisers, he reached back to the Clinton administration.One of the few fresh faces in Obama’s cabinet was Council of Economic Advisers chair Christina Romer. In December 2008, the Berkeley economist calculated that to fill the hole caused by the Great Recession, the economyneedednearly$1.8 trillionin stimulus. As the economy continued to deteriorate, it became clear that Romer’s estimate was, if anything,too small.But Peter Orszag, Rahm Emanuel, and Larry Summers — all Clinton White House veterans —insistedthat $1.8 trillion, or anything close to it, was too large. Substantively, they knewit wasn’t. But politically they felt it was unreasonable. Why? Because it could “spook markets,” in Summers’s words, and would quash any hope of Republican support, which Obama believed was politically desirable. In the end, the stimulus Obama signed into law was less than half the size Romer initially calculated, and nearlyone-thirdof it wastax cuts. Yet it still garneredzeroGOP votes in the House.On top of that, the technocratic bent of Obama’s advisers undercut what should’ve been the most popular parts of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Instead of doling out the tax cuts in eye-catching lump-sum checks — as Bush had done with hisstimulus— Obama’s law simply had the government withhold slightly less from each American’s paycheck, on the assumption that it would make them more likely to spend it.It was a political disaster. While it helped slow some of the economic bleeding, the stimulus was at once too small and too opaque to usher in a twenty-first century New Deal. (It also might have unwittingly fueled antigovernment sentiment: asmanyscholarshave argued, relying on hidden “tax expenditures” tends to make recipients see their benefits as a natural outcome of the market, rather than a government program.)Unlike the stimulus, Obama didn’t need Congress’s approval to attack the foreclosure crisis. The Wall Street bailout bill signed by George W. Bush had given the executive branch the authority to “prevent avoidable foreclosures.” And Obama had public opinion behind him: amajorityof Americanswantedthe administration to step in and stop foreclosures. But doing so would mean forcing the banks — one of Obama’s biggest donors — to swallow losses.The administration’s solution to the foreclosure crisis proved even more disastrous than the ARRA.As journalist David Dayenhasdocumented, Obama initially promised to pursue “cramdown” measures to provide relief to underwater homeowners. But Tim Geithner’s Treasury Department not onlyrecantedon Obama’s cramdown promise, it passed over opportunities to provide direct financial assistance to homeowners or to create a Home Owner’s Loan Corporation–type program to buy up and renegotiate mortgages.Between September 2008 and the end of 2015, more than six million Americans lost their homes. Most homeowners who applied for the administration’s program, the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) were turned down. Often servicers replicated the shady tactics that had triggered the financial crisis in the first place, “losing” applicants’ paperwork and giving them the runaround.Ultimately, as Dayen has argued, HAMP simply intensified struggling homeowners’ cynicism about the Obama administration and government action more generally. Areas where homeownerssaw their wealth evaporateduring the financial crisis (an outcome the Obama administration could’ve prevented) went for Trump in 2016. “Obama’s handling of the mortgage crisis,” Dayen writes, “may have cost Hillary Clinton the election.”If the little-known HAMP acted as a political ticking time bomb for the Democrats, the political effects of the Affordable Care Act’s shortcomings were almost immediate.During his run for the White House, Obama promised to make health care reform negotiations transparent,pledgingto televise them on C-SPAN. But once in office, Obama turned to closed-door meetings. Out of public view, the White House constructed the Affordable Care Act to win the support of insurancecompaniesand theconservativeDemocrats doing theirbidding. This meant dropping the public option, which was not only the plan’s mostprogressiveelement, but also the mostpopularwith the public.Legislatively, the administration treaded softly,eschewingcalls from progressive Democrats to pass the ACA (or even the public optionalone) using budget reconciliation — a process that would have required only fifty votes, thereby eliminating the need for support from centrist Democrats — and declining to put public pressure on wavering Democrats.For his part, Obamafailedto effectively explain the bill to the public or get voters involved in pressing for a better one. Coming off a campaign that mobilized millions of grassroots supporters, Obama could’ve used his formidable campaign organization, Organizing for America (OFA), to make Democratic holdouts feel the political heat. Instead, the Obama team demobilized OFA by rolling it into the DNC andforbadeOFAfrom pushing moderate Democrats to support the health care bill. When other progressive organizations attempted to run ads against Democratic holdouts, Obama’s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, called them “fucking retards” and told them to drop the campaign.The only pressure campaigns the White House allowed OFA and other progressive groups to engage in were those against Republicans. And when it was all said and done, Obama still didn’t garner anyGOPvotes.The recalcitrance shouldn’t have come as a surprise. On Inauguration Day 2009, Republican leaders had met with conservative activists to map out a strategy oftotaloppositionto Obama’s agenda. Their goal was to keep the economy weak, which would not only facilitate Republican victories in the midterms but also, as Senate minority leader Mitch McConnellwould later state, help make Obama a one-term president. Part of the GOP’s plan was tothwartany economic recoveryby imposing a gridlock-driven austerity.Out of naiveté or stubbornness, Obama continued trying to work with a Republican Party that had little interest in anything other than sabotaging his presidency.When his approval rating declined in 2009, Obama attributed it to his failure to achieve bipartisan consensus, not the economy’s continued sluggishness. As Ryan Lizzareported, Obama “became intent on responding to critics of government spending and, as White House memos show, he settled into the role of a more transactional and less transformational leader.”Instead of pursuing a second round of stimulus, as Romer recommended, Obama took a page out of the DLC playbook and turned his attention to budget-cutting,creatingwhat would become known as the “Simpson-Bowles” commission — little more than a platform for efforts tocut taxesfor the well-off andslash Social Security.More fatefully, Obama attempted to strike a deficit-cutting “grand bargain” with the GOP following the 2010 midterms. Many Republicans had campaigned in the midterms vowing to use the debt ceiling to force budget cuts. Rather than drawing a line in the sand and refusing to negotiate, Obama followed the advice of Chief of Staff Bill Daley — a former bank executive who believed deficit reduction would be politically popular — and David Plouffe, his new political adviser. As one administration officialtoldtheNew Republic, “Plouffe specifically said, ‘We’re going to need a period of ugliness’ — he meant with the left — so that people in the center understand that we’re not wasting their tax dollars.”In reality, the federal budget deficitrankedfarbehindjobs and the general state of the economy in Americans’ minds in both 2010 and 2011. But — in keeping with the New Democrats’ fixation on the views of Wall Street insiders and well-off whites — the Obama administration elevated the deficit and investor “confidence” to its top priority.Afterseveralabortiveattemptsto reach a “grand bargain,” the White House and congressional Republicans struck a deal to raise the debt ceiling that called for automatic across-the-board budget cuts (“sequestration”) beginning in 2013 if a different “grand bargain” wasn’t reached. It wasn’t, and the sequester took effect, to thegleeof right-wingers like Grover Norquist, whoenthused, “Sequester is the big win. It defines the decade.”Though its effects wouldn’t be felt until 2013, there was good reason for Norquist to gloat. A variety of estimates — ranging from theCongressional Budget Office, theInternational Monetary Fund, and the conservativeTax Foundationto the labor-liberalEconomic Policy Institute— suggested that the sequester would knock between one half and one and a half points off GDP growth and cost the economy more than a half a million jobs. Given the centrality of the economy toelection prospects, the sequester would’ve made victory harder for any Democratic presidential candidate come 2016.Obama’s first term ended up looking a lot less like FDR’s anda lot more likeJimmy Carter’s.The Populist PivotBy late 2011, Obama’s approvalratingswere at their first-term nadir. The public’s economic concerns had mushroomed since Obama’s inauguration, and Americans were morepessimisticabout their economic situation than they had been in 2010, when Tea Party Republicans swept the midterm elections. The president needed a new message.Obama found it in December 2011, delivering a widely coveredspeechin Osawatomie, Kansas in which he called income inequality “the defining issue of our time.” Obama distanced himself from the Wall Street bailout, admitted the recovery wasn’t reaching the lower rungs of the economic ladder, chastised the rich for distorting American democracy, and committed himself, at least rhetorically, to fighting the inequality that lay at the root of America’s problems.While Obama left unmentioned Democrats’ role in constructing the unequal economy he decried, the address —inspiredboth by the Occupy Wall Street movement and Vice President Joe Biden’s insistence that Obama strike a more populist tone — was the strongest anti-inequality speech delivered by a president since LBJ.When the general election rolled around,manypunditsargued that Obama should focus on GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s “flip-flops,” a relatively non-ideological strategy. The president’s reelection campaignstrategistsconsideredthe “flip-flop” approach, but ultimatelytooka different tack.In a marked rebuke to DLC-style, pro-business platitudes, Obama ran a campaign designed to frame Romney as the human embodiment of theforcesthat had fueled inequality and sparked the financial crisis, all whilecastingObama as a populist defender of the working and middle classes. “The onetime campaign of hope and change soon began a sustained advertising assault that cast Romney as a heartless executive, a man who willingly fires people and is disconnected from how average Americans live their lives,” theWashington Postwrote.Predictably, neoliberal Democrats promised electoral disaster if Obama continued to dance with thepopulistdevil. The DLC’s MarshalladvisedObama to abandon his strategy and instead target moderate swing voters with a “post-partisan” message that favored “GDP growth,” “fiscal responsibility,” and “creating a climate conducive to entrepreneurship and business success.”“However much liberals may yearn to run against ‘vulture capitalism’ or growing disparities of wealth and income, for example, the need to win big among moderates will likely temper Democrats’ appetite for unbridled populism,” he wrote. “And base mobilization, while always important, cannot be the centerpiece of Obama’s 2012 campaign.”The centrist Third Way think tank produced astudyidentifying “Swing Independents” as the key to Obama’s reelection. This group, Third Way insisted, saw themselves as “haves” rather than “have nots,” believed the economic system was fair, and worried more about the budget deficit than income inequality.Though Third Way didn’t specify the race or class of “Swing Independents,” their data revealed them to be overwhelmingly white and well-educated. In addition,ascriticsnoted, Third Way’s poll questions employed Mark Penn–esque creative phrasing to elicit favorable answers. More neutral polls compiled by theNation’s Ari Bermanfoundthat Obama’s populist rhetoric scored high marks. Nonetheless, pundits likeBill Kellerof theNew York Timesseized on the Third Way study and urged Obama to stop “trying out for the role of Robin Hood.”Obama faced pushback from some of his fellow Democrats, too. Then–Newark mayor Cory Booker called Obama’s attacks on Romney’s Bain Capital “nauseating.” “If you look at the totality of Bain Capital’s record,” Bookersaidon NBC’sMeet the Press, “they’ve done a lot to support businesses [and] to grow businesses.” Former president Bill Clinton also popped up tocriticizeObama’s assaults on Romney’s “sterling business career.”But despite naysaying from Clinton, Booker, and other Third Way types, the Obama campaign stayed the course.Barack Obama casts his ballot in Chicago during early voting on October 25, 2012. Obama White House / FlickrFor good measure, the campaign upped its ground game, too. The Obama team’s internalreviewof its 2008 campaign had “concluded that the single most effective medium in reaching a potential Obama voter was not TV ads or glossy mail but contact from an enthusiastic human being.” One academicanalysisfound that Obama’s local field officeadvantagehad secured him three states in 2008 — Florida, Indiana, and North Carolina — that otherwise would’ve gone for McCain.In 2012, the Obama campaign increased its field offices andexpandedits volunteer base by 80 percent. (The Democrats’ ground game also received a boost from the AFL-CIO, who contacted eight hundred thousand voters in Ohio in the final four days of the campaign alone.)Despite the Romney campaign’sconvictionthat the polls were “skewed” against the GOP ticket and that Romney’stech-centricget-out-the-vote effort would overtake Obama’s ground game, Obama triumphed by four points in the popular vote.A Democracy Corpspollconducted the night of and the night after the election found that the Obama campaign successfully tapped into the country’s “populist mood” by making Romney synonymous with Wall Street and the rich.Not only had Obama largely maintained the support of the diverse Millennial generation that had helped propel him to victory in 2008, he’d also held onto the support of a significant number of non-college-educated white voters, who — despitedisagreeingwith Obama on some social issues — turned against Romneybecausehe opposed funding for Planned Parenthood and was seen as “rich and out of touch with average people.”So broad was Obama’s backing that even if black turnout in 2008 and 2012 had remained the same as in 2004, he still would’vewon. He “would have won re-election even if he hadn’t won the Hispanic vote at all,” theNew York Times’ Nate Cohn wrote. “He would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004.”That’s because Obama did startlingly well among whites in the North, including non-college-educated whites. “Overall, 34 percent of Mr. Obama’s voters [in 2012] were whites without a college degree — larger in number than black voters, Hispanic voters or well-educated whites,” Cohn noted. Obama picked up key Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, pulling alargershare of non-college whites than in other states.In an inversion of the ideal DLC pattern, Obamalostmore ground among college-educated whites between 2008 and 2012 than among non-college whites. Hecleaned upin cities and inner-ring suburbs en route to his win, while Romney racked up his votes in rural areas and the New Democrats’ coveted exurbs and “emerging suburbs.”With Republicans in control of Congress, whatever lessons Obama learned about the vices of moderation and the virtues of populism wouldn’t be reflected in policy. But it seemed that his reelection strategy, along with the success of candidates running on a populist anti–Wall Streetmessagein the 2014 midterms, pointed the way forward for Democrats in 2016.The holdover New Democrats had other ideas.The Return of ClintonismWriting in late 2013, former DLCers William Galston and Elaine Kamarckpainteda sunny picture of the Democrats’ chances in 2016. Favorabledemographics, they argued, made Democratic dominance almost inevitable — no policy or strategy changes necessary.Galston and Kamarck weren’t alone.In the years leading up to 2016, many Democraticstrategists and punditsconfidently predicted thatshiftingdemographicswould deliver durable Democratic majorities for the foreseeable future.Variously dubbed the “coalition of the ascendant,” the “emerging Democratic majority,” and the “rising American electorate,” the new coalition supposedly rendered inevitable by demographic changes bore a striking resemblance to the one that the DLC had been pushing the party to assemble for decades. AsPoliticoexplained, it would becomprisedof “relatively upscale whites with racial and ethnic minorities,” allowing Democrats to ignore both working-class whites (whom the party now ceded to the GOP) and people of color (who had nowhere else to go besides the Democratic Party).In political terms, then, the Democrats’ new coalition would be defined by appeals to well-off whites. This necessitated, as Third Way and other New Democrats repeatedlydeclared, steering clear of economic populism and embracing a positive, pro-market message.The new common sense about a burgeoning Democratic majority would underpin the campaign of Hillary Clinton, who Democratic Party leaders had viewed as the presumptive 2016 nominee since her loss to Obama in 2008.While both Bernie Sanders’s surprisingly strong showing in the Democratic primary and theeconometricmodelspredictinga tossup in the general should’ve been a warning to party leaders, the Clinton campaign pressed onward with its strategy. And it couldn’t have asked for a better opponent than Donald Trump — or a better candidate than Hillary Clinton.In the eyes of Democratic elitesandmostpundits, Trump’s right-wing populism was tailor-made toalienateeducated suburban whites, while Clinton’s business-friendly technocratic moderation was perfectly suited to their tastes. Geoff Garin, the pollster for Clinton’s super PAC,predictedthat Clinton would make huge inroads among educated white suburbanites (even college-educated Republican men), because they were “turned off by Trump, both stylistically and by his economic approach.”In the view of Democratic Party insiders, losses among white working-class voters repelled by Clinton’s business-friendly record and attracted to Trump’s populism would be more than offset by gains among well-off whites.“For every blue-collar Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two or three moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia,” Chuck SchumertoldtheWashington Post, in a variant of the mantra he’drepeatthroughout the campaign. “The voters who are most out there figuring out what to do are not the blue-collar Democrats. They are the college-educated Republicans or independents who lean Republican in the suburbs.”Following this logic, the Clinton campaign went out of its way to charm moderate Republicans. Itoverruledthe DNC’scampaignstrategy, which called for boosting both Clinton and down-ballot Democrats by portraying Trump and the GOP as two sides of the same extremist coin. Instead, as DNC communications director Luis Miranda wrote in an email, the Clinton campaign wanted to “disaggregate Trump from down ballot Republicans” in the belief that doing so would make it easier for moderate Republican voters to cast ballots for Clinton.Clinton’s advertisements contained the least amount of policy content for a presidential campaign since at least 2000.Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a town hall meeting in Manchester, NH in January 2016. Gage Skidmore / FlickrRather than slamming Trump for his record as a rapacious businessman — as Obama had done to Romney — ClintonstressedTrump’s noxious personality. She touted every endorsement she received from Republicans, and gave billionaires likeMeg WhitmanandMichael Bloombergstarring roles in her campaign.The result, asBuzzfeed’s Ruby Cramersummarized, was a campaign that didn’t “talk about Republican extremism or Republican rhetoric or Republican ideology” and instead focused “almost exclusively about Donald Trump, his temperament, his qualifications, his character, and his fitness to serve, leaving the rest of the Democratic Party to adjust to a general election that has little to do with traditional partisan policy or politics.”More than three-quarters of Clinton’s campaign advertisements foregrounded Trump’s character. No candidatehad ever devotedsuch a large share of ads to a single issue. Less than 10 percent of Clinton’s ads addressed the economy, whereas 34 percent of Trump’s did. In fact, Clinton’s advertisements contained the least amount of policy content for a presidential campaign since at least 2000.This contrast, as astudyby the Wesleyan Media Project noted, was especially pronounced in Wisconsin and Michigan, where voters received “policy-based (and specifically economically-focused) messaging from Trump” and attacks on Trump’s “personality and fitness for office (in a sense, doubling down on the news media’s focus)” from Clinton, a decision that left “very little room for discussion in advertising of the reasons why Clinton herself was the better choice.”The Clinton campaign departed from Obama’s 2012 game plan in other ways, too. While Obama relied on a massive ground game informed by data, Clinton’s advisers — likemanyother Democrats — believed that the numbers were by far the more important factor. The Clinton campaign put its faith in an algorithm namedAda, which ran four hundred thousand simulations of the race per day in order to guide “virtually every strategic decision” the campaign made, including where to put field offices, where to campaign, and where to air television ads.This data-centric strategy not only jettisoned the Obama ground game model, it also ignored mountains of research showing that door-to-door efforts are the “gold standard” of mobilization. The Clinton campaign,Politicoreported, “believed that television and limited direct mail and digital efforts were the only way to win over voters” and “dismissed what’s known as in-person ‘persuasion’ — no one was knocking on doors.” In Michigan, for example, Clinton hadone-tenththe number of paid canvassers as Kerry had in 2004.If Clinton’s ground game fell wellshortof Obama, it also turned out to be downrightinept— a shortcoming that numerous Democrats and progressive groupspointed outbeforethe election. According to some estimates, Clinton’s use of data-driven get-out-the-vote efforts, rather than traditional door-to-door ones, may have led her campaign toaccidentallyturn out a significantnumberof Trump voters.Clinton’spartialitytoward TV ads — as opposed to door-to-door efforts — might seem irrational in retrospect. But it fit with the campaign’s overall philosophy.Clinton’s campaign was oriented toward convincing well-off moderate whites — who were already likely to vote — to desert Trump and cast their ballot for Clinton. The remaining pieces of the Democratic coalition, the Clinton campaign believed, would fall in line. As theHuffington Post’s Natalie Jacksonexplained, the Clinton campaign “didn’t make concerted efforts” to get voters in heavily Democratic, African-American areas to the polls largely because it assumed that those voters “would support the party in large numbers — which they do, when they vote.”Many liberal pundits who were bullish about Clinton’s chancesdismissedpolls and on-the-ground reports thatpredictedlowerenthusiasm and turnout among African Americans. Many of those same pundits alsopredictedthat non-college-educated whites wouldn’t vote for Trump in much greater margins than they’d voted for Mitt Romney (a prognostication given grist by Trump’s low approval ratings among this cohort early in the campaign). The same pundits were even morecertainthat Clinton would clean up among college-educated whites, particularly college-educated white women.In the final months of the campaign, the Clinton team expected a blowout. They talked of “expandingthe map” by making late plays for a handful of red states. The wonk press, whose election models predicted certain victory for Clinton, echoed the Clinton team’s confidence.Then came Election Day.The Working-Class Authoritarianism Thesis, ReduxClinton carried out the New Democratic “class inversion” strategy almost perfectly. She performed better among upscale whites than any Democrat in history. Yet not only was it not enough to win the election, it wasn’t even enough to win that demographic. Trumpprevailedamong suburbanites 49 to 45 and whites with a college education 48 to 45, and the white women Clinton targeted voted for Trump at thesameratesthat they’d gone for Romney in 2012.“Among the theories the Clinton campaign held during the election was that college-educated Republicans would be so repulsed by the prospect of a Trump presidency that many would cast a vote to prevent it from happening,”Huffington Post’s Sam Steinwroteshortly after the election. “Yet what caught the Clinton campaign off guard was both how many of these voters would ultimately hold their nose and vote for Trump anyway.”Had Trump been unable to retain a slim lead among college-educated whites, his gains among college-less whiteswouldn’thave been enough to deliver him the White House. But despite the Clinton campaign’s fervent attempts to win well-off whites — who they hoped would vote for her even if they favored down-ballot Republicans — the election saw perhaps thelowest levelof split-ticket voting in US history.The notion that Trump would turn off many affluent, moderate Republicans was naïve. As the Working Families Party’s Joe Dinkinquipped, “being a Republican voter means already having come to terms with voting for disgusting racists and sexists sometimes.”The narrowness of Trump’s victory in key Midwestern states means thatanynumberof things — FBI director James Comey’sletter, GOP-led voter suppression, etc. — can be said to have cost Clinton the election.But the real question is why the election was so close in the first place, given that Democrats had the advantage of a popular incumbent president, a historicallyweakGOP candidate, and an economy that was, at worst, a nonfactor. “She got this gift of this complete idiot who says bizarre things and hates women and she still lost,” one anonymous Clinton fundraisertoldPolitico. “They lost in a race they obviously should have won.”Yet in explaining Clinton’s loss, most pundits didn’t point to the flaws in her strategy or the fact that upscale whites weren’t as nauseated by Trump’s bigotry as liberals expected. Instead, they pointed the finger at non-college-educated whites, a group that many pundits dubiously equated with the white working class.In part, this was because the education gap in voting among whites was immense. Clintonperformedten points better among college-educated whites than Obama had in 2012. But she performed fourteen points worse than Obama had in 2012 among non-college whites.Clinton’s poor performance among this voting bloc shouldn’t have come as a surprise. After all, the Clinton campaign’s strategy explicitlyignoredthese voters. The decision not to go after them wasan ideological one. She wasintenton capturing the New Democrats’ ideal electoral cohort: “socially moderate, fiscally selfish suburbanites” — asNew Yorkmagazine’s Eric Levitz glibly put it — not blue-collar voters.“What part of Hillary Clinton’s message was aimed at less educated white voters?” Cohnaskedrhetorically. “It just wasn’t at the core of her appeal this year. It was nothing like 2012, when President Obama relentlessly focused on the middle class, Bain Capital, the auto bailout, etc.”The notion that Trump would turn off many affluent, moderate Republicans was naïve.Hillary Clinton’s campaign office in Washington DC. Lorie Shaull / FlickrNonetheless, many Democrats and liberal pundits were incredulous that Clinton had won the support of so few non-college-educated whites. To them, the notion that Clinton’s economic message should’ve connected with downscale whiteswasself–evident. And because the unemploymentratewas below 5 percent, pundit after punditdeclaredconfidently that Trump’s support had nothing to do with the economy, even when some Trump supporterssaid otherwise.Instead, pundits put forward an explanation for Clinton’s losses among non-college whites that (sometimesquiteliterally) harkened back to the “working-class authoritarianism” thesis of the 1950s and ’60s and the subsequent debates about the decline in white workers’ support for Democrats.Numerousstudiesthroughout the campaignshowedthat Trump’s supporters weremorelikely to agree with statements expressingstereotypesabout African Americans and other groups.Punditsseized on this finding, andrepeatedlyarguedthat racism alone explained Clinton’s failure to connect with non-college-educated whites.Vox’s Matt Yglesias, for example, called economics a “fake” explanation for Trump’s rise. “While plenty of people, including plenty of Trump fans, certainly have concerns about the economy, it’s racial resentment that drives who does and doesn’t support Trump,” Yglesiaswrotelast August. “Adding an economic anxiety factor to your account doesn’t actually help to explain anything.” Similarly,Slate’s Jamelle Bouiearguedthat any suggestion that not all Trump voters were motivated primarily by racism was “perverse, bordering on abhorrent.” It reached the point where ironically tweeting “Economic anxiety!” in response to a Trump supporter’s racist outburst became thejokedu jour among pundits.To be sure, a vote for Trump was a vote that, at a minimum, implied a toleration of overt bigotry. But the prevailing narrative is incomplete. Treating racism as the axiomatic explanation for Trump’s appeal to some non-college-educated whites implies that all ballots cast for Trump were motivated principally by racism, while absolving college-educated Clinton voters of racism and ignoring the real economic crisis facing many Americans.Indeed, despite the sharp lines pundits drew between the whites who backed Trump and the whites who backed Clinton, many white Clinton supporters (likemanyObama voters)sharedthe racist views of Trump’s “deplorable” supporters. For example, a little over 30 percent of Trump supporters and a little over 20 percent of Clinton supporters told pollsters that blacks are less “intelligent” than whites. (Ironically, given Clinton proponents’ attempts during the primary to portray their candidate’s coalition as the most racially liberal, surveys found that Sanders supporters were consistently theleastlikely to agree with racist stereotypes.)What’s more, thesurveyquestionsabout racial stereotypestell usmore about overt racism than about racism in a broader sense. As early as the 1970s, scholars were questioning the idea that more educated whites were more racially liberal than working-class whites in any meaningful sense. More recent research has confirmed this finding.While whites with higher education levels are less likely to express explicitly racist sentiments, they’renotmore likely to support programs to combat racial disadvantage. Likewise, whites tend to have similar scores onimplicitracialbiastests across education levels. This suggests that “social desirability bias” causes more educated whites to avoid voicing overt racism, even if racism shapes both their policy views and their unconscious biases.In the process of defending Clinton’s economic moderation against criticisms from the left, some pundits unintentionally conceded just as much. According to Clinton’sdefenders, Democrats embracing Sanders-style policies — free college, single-payer health care, and the like —wouldalienate“well-off socially liberal voters.” The clear implication, of course, is that the supposedly socially progressive, well-educated whites of the “rising American electorate” would rather support the racist, sexist, homophobic party than pay a little more in taxes to fund an expanded welfare state.Moreover, even if the fact that a greater percentage of Trump’s supporters are willing to affirm racist statements tells us something about the motivations of hardcore Trumpers, it doesn’t tell us much about the non-college-educated whites who were turned off by both candidates but ultimately voted for Trump, despite disliking many of his policies and personal traits. These “marginal” Trump voters, as even critics of the “economic anxiety” argument likeYglesiasandBouiehaveacknowledged, weren’t necessarily motivated by racism in the same way as committed Trump voters.In fact, a majority of Trump supporterssawtheir vote as opposed to Clinton, rather than for Trump. Hewonnearly 30 percent of voters who were “bothered” by his treatment of women, 20 percent of those who didn’t think he was “honest and trustworthy,” and 17 percent of those who didn’t think he was qualified to serve as president. Even more strikingly, more thanhalfof his supporters said they favored a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, rather than mass deportation.The 2016 election was a contest between twohistorically unpopularcandidates. But a record number of people who disliked both major party options turned out. “[A]n astonishing 18% of the electorate told us they had an unfavorable opinion of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,” Edison Researchreported.Notably, half of “neither” voters viewed Obama favorably. Nonetheless these voters — including many who liked Obama — broke to Trump by a decisive 49 percent to 29 percent nationally and by even larger margins in some key swing states. “[T]his,” Edison concluded, “is the group that won the election for Trump.” Trumpwon19 percent of non-college-educated whites who approved of Obama, 20 percent of those who identified as liberal, and 38 percent of those who wanted policies more liberal than Obama’s.Trump’s decisive victory among non-college-educated whites came not from self-identified conservatives, who almost always vote for the GOP, but from hisdoublingof Romney’s margin among non-college whites who identify as neither conservative nor liberal.Pollster Guy Molyneuxsurveyedand conducted eight focus groups with these “moderates.” Contrary to the common assumption that social conservatism drove this bloc to Trump, Molyneux found that they were much more socially liberal than the conservative whites who enthusiastically backed Trump. Only 36 percent of white moderates without a college degree, for example, believed that racial and ethnic diversity was bad for the nation.Non-GOP Trump voters liked verydifferentthings about Trump than the GOP base. They placed high priority on his promises not to cut Medicare and Social Security and to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. Their main worry was that Trump would turn around and cut taxes for the rich. As a group of political scientistsfound, Trump peeled off a specific portion of whites: “populists” on economic issues who hold conservative views on social issues.This group had overwhelmingly pulled the lever for Obama in 2012, making up roughly 12 percent of his coalition. “By strategic design or dumb luck,” the political scientists noted, “the Trump candidacy was able to activate a segment of the electorate that has historically not been part of the GOP electoral coalition.”Earlier this year, the results of a Roosevelt Institute/ Democracy Corpsfocus groupconfirmed both the belief that racism has put some of these voters out of reach and the argument that others can be won back with better economic appeals.Many saw Clinton as a wealthy ally of Wall Street and genuinely believed Trump’s claims that his wealth meant he wouldn’t be beholden to deep-pocketed donors. But they expect him to deliver the jobs and good, cheap health care he promised — promises he’s of course failed to keep.Two-thirds of the focus group liked Democrats like Sanders, Sherrod Brown, and Elizabeth Warren, “who support American jobs and strongly opposed NAFTA and Obama’s trade deal, support policies to protect consumers from Wall Street and reckless banks, want to get corporations to invest in their own workers and this country, want to end tax breaks for companies sending jobs overseas, and want to bar secret corporate campaign money so our government works for the middle class again.”The sobering reality for Democrats is that Clinton lost much of this group on economic issues, not “cultural” ones. While college-less white moderates enthusiastically support increased taxation of the rich and a variety of social programs, they’re convinced that most politicians only care about the wealthy and have no real interest in pursuing policies that benefit non-elites.The result is a kind of desultory fiscal conservatism, born not out of ideology, but cynicism. And the New Democratic strategy of attracting college-educated voters only serves to confirm these workers’suspicionthat Democrats, like society as a whole, “does not value people who work with their hands.”While the Clinton campaignbelievedthat it was fruitless to reach out to undecided blue-collar whites, they nonetheless expressed confidence that these voters would, in the end, support Clinton and Trump in even numbers.In reality most late-deciding votersswung toTrump — but not for the reasons many Democrats offered in the wake of the election. Despite the belief that then–FBI director James Comey played spoiler,fewwhite swing voters cited the Comey letter as the deciding factor in their vote.Diane Hessan, who conducted a longitudinal study of the same white undecided voters throughout 2016 for the Clinton campaign,notedthat these voters intensely disliked both candidates. Yet few of the major attack lines — from Clinton’s emails to Trump’s racism — moved these voters, who already thought the worst of both. What did decisively shift them to Trump, according to Hessan, was Clinton’s “deplorables” comment, which made these voters believe that “Clinton was an out-of-touch rich person who didn’t really get it.”She didn’t, and that’s because she was following the DLC’s decades-old dream of making upscale whites the center of the Democratic coalition.“Economic Anxiety” and the Multiracial Working Class“For the past eight years,” theGuardian’s Gary Youngewrotein January, “American liberals have gorged themselves on symbolism. A significant section of the population, including those most likely to support Barack Obama, have felt better about their country even as they have fared worse in it.”Indeed, near the end of Obama’s presidency, pluralities of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats still said they were “falling behind” financially — with low-income and high school–educated respondents especially likely to say so. Fewer than four in ten Democrats rated the economy as “excellent or good,” and fewer than three in ten Independents and two in ten Republicans did.Many Americans have good reason to feel anxious about their economic situation. Despite a falling unemployment rate, large swaths of the populationhaven’t seenthe fruits of the recovery, and the Great Recession itself capped decades of diminishing economic prospects.Most American households have experienced stagnant or, at best, modest income growth for the past forty years. And even this gloomy picture conceals a more depressing reality. The main source of wage growth for most households — partially because of the mass entry of women into the workforce — has beenincreasedworking hours,not increased pay. Hourly wages have been flat for most Americans since the late 1970s.While few groups of workers have fared well in the past four decades, those without college degrees have fared the worst — their median income hasfallen. The drop in high school–educated men’s incomes has beenparticularlydramatic.Thecollapsein manufacturing employment has fundamentally changed the job prospects for high school–educated Americans, and reshaped the very landscape of Rust Belt cities. Places like Gary, Flint,Youngstown, andMansfieldare shells of their former selves.And, asresearchhasshown, voters are right to point the finger at policies implemented by theClinton administrationand continued by Bush and Obama. Workers in “low-skilled” occupations have been systematicallyexposedto competition, while well-off professionals have been shielded from the same forces — gutting the working-class job market, exacerbating inequality, and stoking alienation and resentment.Whites in poor Appalachian towns like Nelsonville, Ohio that had voted for Obamaexpressedfrustration with the idea that the economy had turned around since the Great Recession. The same was true oftownsinWisconsinthat flipped from Obama to Trump.The recovery has actually exacerbated the stratification in the job market. A 2016studyby Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce found that 11.5 out of the 11.6 million jobs created had gone to workers with at least some college education. Workers with a high school diploma or less, in contrast, “have experienced no job recovery” — they’ve seen just 80,000 jobs generated compared to the 5.6 million lost during the recession, making them the only group to experience net job losses since 2007.“The human cost of these trends for workers without postsecondary education, their families, and their communities has been immense,” the Georgetown report notes. “As factories and mines have closed and office and administrative support functions have been automated, men and women without a college education . . . found themselves out of a job, often for prolonged periods of time and, in some cases, even detached from the labor force. . . . Those who were lucky enough to find another job after being laid off or displaced often did so at a price — lower wages, which often take decades to rebuild to their pre-displacement levels.”Many Americans have good reason to feel anxious about their economic situation. Despite a falling unemployment rate, large swaths of the population haven’t seen the fruits of the recovery.A worker in Chicago. Tyler Bedgood / FlickrThe bleak landscape for non-college-educated workers has interacted with race in ways that seem almost designed to boost Trump’s chances. As theNew York Times’ Eduardo Porter hasreported, recent job losses have disproportionately hit white workers, a trend that’s visible in thewagesof non-college-educated white men. In line with this observation, polls have found that non-college-educated whites are themostpessimisticgroup in America.Not surprisingly, Trump’s support wasconcentratedincountiesthat experienced high levels of tradecompetitionand job loss as a result of trade policies, as well asareaswith the weakest job growth, lowest earnings, and highest percentage of “routine” jobs. One post-electionstudyby a team of economists found that competition from China had a decisive effect on the election in states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. In many key counties that flipped from Obama to Trump, historian Mike Davishas noted, a “high-profile plant closure or impending move had been on the front page of the local newspaper [during the campaign]: embittering reminders that the ‘Obama boom’ was passing them by.”Clinton’s campaign made little effort to speak to these workers’ concerns. As theAtlantic’s Molly Ballwrote, “[Clinton’s] ‘America is already great’ message didn’t carry far beyond the degree-rich elites who are indeed doing fine these days, particularly against Trump’s message of right-wing economic populism.” Even when Clinton attempted to make her case to blue-collar whites, she lapsed into DLC speak. “I want to really marry the public and the private sector,” shetoldGeorge Packer. “I think we haven’t organized ourselves for the twenty-first-century globalization.”Clinton might have had more substantive plans on her website, but few marginal Trump voters were likely to hear about them. Trump’s message, in contrast, was crystal clear. His television adsresemblednothing so muchas a more conservative iteration of Obama’s 2008 pitch.“In Hillary Clinton’s America, the middle class gets crushed, spending goes up, taxes go up, hundreds of thousands of jobs disappear. It’s more of the same, but worse,” theannouncerin one swing-state Trump TV ad intoned. “In Donald Trump’s America, working families get tax relief, millions of new jobs created, wages go up, small businesses thrive. The American dream, achievable. Change that makes America great again.” Clinton, meanwhile, wasrunningnarrative-free commercials set to Katy Perry’s “Roar.”While the dire economic prospects facing non-college whites doesn’t excuse a vote for Trump, it helps explain it. Economic dislocation has stoked the rise of the far rightthroughouthistory. The relationship between economic distress and racism iscomplex. As Sean McElwee and Jason McDanielfound, “economic insecurity tends to increase feelings of racial resentment, and . . . white liberals and marginally attached Democrats are particularly susceptible to increased racial resentment during times of economic crisis.”Republicans can exploit whites’ economic anxiety because, unlike many people of color, whites have the racial luxury of a choice between parties. But the fact that voters in other groups don’t do the same doesn’t mean that they’re happy with the neoliberal policy consensus embodied by Clinton’s campaign.In the lead-up to the election, many pundits expressed confidence that ignoring the white working class would allow Democrats to move left on social issues, thereby energizing young people and people of color.Slate’s Bouie laid out a version of this in early October. “A Democratic Party that doesn’t need to win more than a modest minority of working-class white men is one that can lean further toward racial liberalism, to mobilize its black and Latino supporters and to win over those culturally liberal whites,” hewrote. Clinton would defeat Trump, he continued, “with a revamped Obama coalition, comprising nonwhites; young voters; and an unprecedented number of moderate, suburban whites.”What these predictions missed is that moderate suburban whites are less committed to antiracism than many commentators assume. They’re also actively hostile to the policies needed to make meaningful progress on either economic or social justice. And the other members of the “rising American electorate” need both now more than ever.The Great Recession hit people of color like a ton of bricks. The housing crisis and rising unemployment disproportionately affected African Americans and Latinos, wiping outhalfof blacks’ wealth andtwo-thirdsof Latinos’ wealth, therebywideningthe existing racialgapsin wealth inequality. Working-class people of color face the same struggles as blue-collar whites, but with the added barrier ofdiscrimination. And the factory closings that pushed some blue-collar whites away from Clinton and toward Trump have decimated the black working class by removing the ladder of opportunitythat had allowedmany white families to prosper.Many Millennials have seen their hopes for upward mobilitydashedand arefacingthe possibilitythat they might do worse than their parents. For kids born in 1940, the chance of making more money than their parents was 92 percent. Those odds have fallen for every generation since, reaching 50 percent for kids born in 1980. Nor has education been a solution. Young college graduates have also seen theirwagesfall.While journalists were busy making “economic anxiety” jokes, numerous studies showed that economic worries have increased in recent years, particularly among people of color.An ongoingsurveyby NPR’s Marketplace found that 39 percent of Americans lose sleep fretting about their personal finances, a sentiment more common among non-whites than whites. According toanother study, the percentage of Americans who have sustained a 25 percent drop in available income, due to things like job loss or medical expenses, has jumped dramatically over the past fifty years. Not surprisingly, black and Latino households are especially likely to have suffered such a decline.Four in ten Americans live in households with high or moderate levels of economic insecurity, according to a Public Religion Research Institutestudy, and this insecurity is especially acute among blacks and Latinos. Almosthalfof Americans would have trouble finding four hundred dollars to pay for an emergency expense. Across a range of measures — finding a good job, owning a home, saving for retirement, affording health care — pluralities or majorities of non-college-educated Americans across racesbelievethings have gotten harder for them in recent years.This is the dismal economic landscape that formed the backdrop of the November election. And it was clear Clinton’s message simply wasn’t speaking to people’s material realities.A pre-election focus group with young African-American voters in Cleveland, Ohio and Jacksonville, FloridademonstratedClinton’sproblemswith black Millenials. “He’s a racist and she is a liar,” a non-college-educated black woman in Cleveland said in one focus group, “so really what’s the difference in choosing both or choosing neither?” Polls showed Clinton trailing Obama by more than twenty points among African Americans in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. “There is no Democratic majority without these voters,” Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher warned in September. “The danger is that if you don’t get these voters out, you’ve got the 2004 John Kerry electorate again.”While it wasn’t 2004 redux, it wasn’t 2008 or 2012 either. A large poll by the African American Research Collaborative completed in early Novemberfoundthat black voters’ enthusiasm for the 2016 campaign was less than half of what it was for the 2012 campaign. Notably, only 18 percent of respondents cited the fact that Obama wasn’t running, while 50 percent said they didn’t like either candidate and 27 percent said the campaign was too negative. Post-election interviews with black residents in a low-income Milwaukee neighborhood revealed that many residents who’d voted in 2008 and 2012 hadn’t in 2016, anddidn’tregret it, because they disliked both Trump and Clinton.Some were sounding the alarm months before voters went to the polls. Last June, progressive journalist John Judisarguedthat the “rage” that fueled Sanders’s candidacy was a reaction to “the failure of New Democrat politics to deliver prosperity or economy security.” “Clinton and the Democrats in Washington don’t understand the level of anxiety that Americans, and particularly the young, feel about their economic prospects,” he wrote. “It can’t be addressed by charts showing the drop in the unemployment rate.”Historian Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor slammed Democrats’ “delusional happy talk about economic recovery” while the country was still experiencing unconscionable poverty rates, rising inequality, and negligible income growth. “The inattention to growing inequality, racial injustice, and deteriorating quality of life,” she predicted, “will likely result in ordinary people voting with their feet and simply opting out of the coming election.”And so they did. Clinton was hampered by lowturnoutin key Democraticgeographicareas and among key Democratic groups,especiallyMillennials and African Americans. AFive Thirty Eightanalysisfound that Clinton underperformed Obama not just in white areas with low levels of education but also in majority-minority areas with low levels of education.Obama secured thesupportof 80 percent of African Americans without a college degree, while Clintongarnered72 percent of such voters, with the main drop-off coming from those who said they planned to stay home in 2016. In Detroit’s Wayne County, for example, Clinton received nearly eighty thousandfewervotesthan Obama in 2012 — more than seven times her loss margin in the entire state — while Trump received only fifteen thousand more than Romney.The story was the same in Wisconsin’s Milwaukee County, where Clinton picked up forty thousand fewer votes than Obama in 2012, and Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County, where turnout in black precincts wasdown11 percent from four years earlier. While GOP votersuppressiontactics may have depressed turnout in Ohio and Wisconsin, states like Michiganhadn’tpassedany new voting restrictions since 2012. African-American voters didn’t show up in the same numbers there either.Simply put, Clinton not only lost the votes of many non-college-educated whites — she alsofailedto energize voters of color and young people.Zombie New DemocratsDespite Clinton’s shocking and disastrous loss, the message Democrats could take from 2016, if the neoliberals have their way, is that the partyshould“double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and college-educated white voters who were the main target of Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” Indeed, in the aftermath of the election, many punditscalledfor Democrats to fully write off non-college-educated whites and focus on flipping even more college-educated whites.The New America Foundation’s Lee Drutman hasencouragedDemocrats to work on making the party a coalition of “highly educated professional whites, especially women, and minority voters,” which he summarizes as the Obama coalition but with “even more of a role for wealthy cosmopolitans” and an even greater focus on “fiscal responsibility,” “international responsibility,” and “global businesses.” (Of course, this same logic led Drutman topredictlast March that Clinton would beat Trump and Democrats would take the Senate, since Clinton’s economic moderation would allow Democrats to “pick up enough moderate Republicans to more than compensate” for any lost “working-class votes.”)Predictably, DLC retreads have blamed Clinton’s defeat on economic populism and, indirectly, on Bernie Sanders. “The campaign with Bernie Sanders shifted the debate toward statist and redistributive solutions and not enough about how we’re going to make the economy grow and make government work better,” Will MarshalltoldtheNew Republicin a post-election interview.The DLC’s Al From sang the same tune. “Democrats should rededicate ourselves to the core New Democrat principles — opportunity, responsibility, community,” Fromwrotein theGuardian. “Economic growth,” From stated with the confidence of a man who’s written the same op-ed since the 1980s, not “redistribution,” is the answer.In January, the Third Wayannouncedthat it was dedicating $20 million “to study how the party lost its way and offer a new economic agenda for moving forward.” Of course, the think tank already knew what the study would find. Its goal,Politiconoted, “is to steer the Democratic Party away from being led into a populist lurch to the left by leaders like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren.”Likewise, Marshall’s New Democracy isurgingDemocrats to strike a tougher, more conservative tone on issues like national defense and immigration and to drop “economic victimhood and business-bashing” in favor of “knowledge economy”-focused “pro-growth tax reform; lowering [of] regulatory obstacles to innovation and entrepreneurship; [and] fiscal policies that favor investment over consumption.”But Third Way and New Democracy’s preferred strategy is exactly the one Democrats have been pursuing for the past forty years. It’s the strategy that led Democrats to enact many of the policies that Black Lives Matter activists are protesting. It’s the strategy that quickened the collapse of the American labor movement. It’s the strategy that pushed Democrats to pass a welfare reform bill that left millions of impoverished Americans worse off. It’s the strategy that convinced Democrats to wait to back marriage equality until corporate America got on board. It’s the strategy that resulted in the passage of the Affordable Care Act, rather than the extension of Medicare to all Americans. It’s the strategy that caused Democrats to back trade deals that put downward pressure on the wages of blue-collar workers of all races, while exempting white-collar workers from the same competition. It’s the strategy that gave us President Donald Trump. It’s a strategy that hasn’t worked and will never work.If college-educated whites are attracted to economically moderate, socially liberal candidates and repelled by economically populist, socially conservative candidates, it’s hard to see how the Democrats could ever stage a better matchup than Clinton versus Trump.Clinton did better among college-educated whites than any past Democrat. But it still wasn’t enough. And had the GOP run a more traditional candidate — a Jeb Bush or a Marco Rubio — it’s likely that Clinton wouldn’t have captured as many votes from college-educated whites.The reality is, most whites with a college degree are less committed to racial justice — and more wedded to GOP tax cuts — than Democrats and liberal pundits imagine. Most importantly, continuing to follow the New Democrats’ strategy will fail to grow and energize the party’s would-be base of workers and poor people of all races.In 2016, as in 2000 and 2004, the Democrats followed the advice of New Democrats, nominating a candidate who downplayed conflictual issues like inequality to woo well-off whites; in all three years they lost a presidential contest that most modelssaidwaswinnable.The New Democrats’ strategy is even more boneheaded at thecongressional level. There are only so many states and districts that contain a critical mass of people of color and well-educated whites. And even at the presidential level, that strategy assumes that simultaneously appealing to both white professionals and Latino workers, for example, will never conflict.In order to win the White House and, especially, take back Congress, Democrats will need to be competitive in states with large numbers of downscale whites. “Democrats can’t rely on increasing support in already-blue states, and it seems that key red states aren’t ready to flip yet,” theHuffington Post’s Natalie Jackson correctlynotes. “The best strategy for 2020 will be to focus on the very narrow losses in the Rust Belt and win those voters back — which probably means convincing them that Democrats are a better option for improving their economy than Republicans.”“The Democrats’ coalition of the ascendant,” one recent studynotes, “is very inefficiently distributed.” So while demographic change might help them win the popular vote, it won’t help them in the Electoral College, Congress, or state legislatures.In addition to losing the White House, as well as House and Senate majorities, Democratshave given upnearly nine hundred legislative seats at the state level since 2008. In 2016, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committeetargetedthirty-two House seats, mostly in Midwestern states. The Democrats won only eight.Unfortunately, the conservatives surrounding Trump understood the failures of neoliberalism better than many Democrats. Back in 2014, GOP pollster (and later Trump adviser) Kellyanne Conwaychampioned“a new open-mindedness to populist approaches, regardless of partisan or ideological preferences” among voters — particularly non-college-educated voters worried about the economic effects of trade.But most mainstream Republicans, still wedded to traditional business conservatism, didn’t want to listen. The best GOP elites had to offer was Frank Luntz’s idea to rebrand “free trade” as “American trade.” When Trump begantalkingaboutworkers hurt by free trade and implying that the bipartisan political establishment cared more about Wall Street than average Americans, Republican leaders bristled. “Most people don’t think, ‘John’s success comes at my expense.’ Or, ‘My success comes at your expense,’” Paul RyantoldCNBC’s John Harwood in March. “People don’t think like that. Bernie Sanders talks about that stuff. That’s not who we are.”But as the success of Trump and Sanders attests, people do “think like that.”A left populist message like the one Sanders offered had a much better shot at defeating Trump.Supporters at a Bernie Sanders campaign rally in October 2015. Phil Roeder / FlickrIt’s a reality that many liberals still don’t want to accept. Adam Davidson, NPR’s economic reporter,arguedthat Clinton was struggling among whites without a college education because Clinton avoided Trump’s demagogic promises of a better future and instead stood by the “calm, reasonable, accurate, right answer” to the problem of falling wages, which was: “Your life is going to be worse for the rest of your life.”“This is part of a bigger problem with American presidential politics selling snake oil to the voters,” Kamarckventedto theNew Republiclast June. “Everybody from Trump with his stupid fucking wall, to Sanders with, ‘Oh, free college for everybody.’ Of all the dumb things. . . . [P]eople want to believe in Peter Pan. And he’s just not there.”But people don’t want to “believe in Peter Pan.” They just want to believe that their lives, and their children’s lives, will improve.Contrary to the New Democratic conventional wisdom, a left populist message like the one Sanders offered had a much better shot at defeating Trump.Many Clinton backers believe that Sanders couldn’t have bested Trump because Trump would’veattackedSanders as, in the words of Kevin Drum, a “wild-eyed communist.” Not only would Sanders have lost, Drumclaimed in December, he would’ve been dispatched in a “landslide.” But Drum’s argument, likemanyothersagainst Sanders, relies on the same vague conventional wisdom that concluded a candidate like Trump had no chance.Even assuming that more radical candidates get penalized a point or two in the popular vote, Sanders still could’vewonby running slightly better than Clinton in key Midwestern swing states — many of which he took in the primaries. And that assumption itself is questionable. Given that Trump’s ideological extremism didn’t cost him the election, it’s worth reevaluating both the assumption that “extreme” candidates face a penalty and our definition of “extreme.”Over the past forty years, the combined influence of Republicanreactionand New Democraticconservatismhas pushed American politics to the right, particularly on economic issues, to the point where most Americans hold more progressive economic views than existing policyreflects. Sanders’s supposedly extreme positions are actually closer to average Americans’ views than those of ostensibly mainstream politicians. If anything, Trump’s win shows that breaking with the “Washington consensus” can actually buoy a candidate.Instead of Clinton’s content-less economic optimism, Sanderswould’ve assertedthat “the system had indeed been rigged, but by people like Trump, against Trump’s own supporters.” It’s a counter-argument perfectly suited to the moment. As a Democracy Corps studyfound, an economic message attacking Trump as the candidate of Wall Street and an adherent of “trickle-down” economics “performed dramatically better in consolidating Millennials, white unmarried women, and white working class women” than a message focused on Trump’s disparaging remarks and unfitness for office.Hypothetical head-to-head polling data by Reuters showed Sanders outperforming Clinton in a matchup with Trump in almost every demographic group. Contrary to claims that Sanders primarily appealed to whites, he polled four points better among people of color than Clinton.Among the less educated whites that helped Trump win, Sanders did even better. He ran thirteen points ahead of Clinton among whites without a high school diploma, eight points better among those with a high school diploma or some college, and three points better among college graduates. Sanders also outpolled Clinton among whites in all income groups except those making over $250,000. In both low-education and low-income groups, the biggest disparity in Sanders’s performance and Clinton’s in a hypothetical showdown with Trump came from voters who said they’d stay home or opt for a third-party candidate if the contest was Clinton versus Trump rather than Sanders versus Trump.Looking at the Rust Belt states Clinton lost by small margins, the contrast is even more striking. For example, in the March to June polls, ClintontrailedTrump 39.5 to 32.6 among whites with some college or less in Michigan; Sanderswonthose voters 44 to 34. Clinton’s percentage among those same votersstayedvirtually the same through Election Day, whereas Trump picked up nearly all of the undecided or uncommitted voters in that category.Sanders scored particularly high marks among young people. Acrosseveryracial category, Americans between eighteen and thirty favored Sanders over Clinton. Sanders not only tapped into the economicfrustrationsof Millennials, he also pushed their views left on a variety of issues. “He’s not moving a party to the left. He’s moving a generation to the left,” John Della Volpe, the director of a Harvard poll of young adultstoldtheWashington Postlast year. “He’s impacting the way in which a generation — the largest generation in the history of America — thinks about politics.”While it’s certainly possible that Sanders could’ve lost to Trump, it’s difficult to argue that his populism would’ve proven a more ineffective parry than Clinton’s neoliberalism.Economic Populism or Antiracist Politics: the False ChoiceIf the 2016 election demonstrated anything, it’s that the type of economic moderation needed to appeal to upscale whites also dampens enthusiasm among the other groups who are supposed to round out the “rising American electorate.”One union staffer got the prescription and remedyright:What [Clinton campaign strategists] seem to have missed is that the way to reach blacks, Latinos, and women is the same way you reach the white working class: progressive economics, and knock on their doors. And guess what? The allegedly “racist” and “sexist” white working class is cool with a multicultural coalition as long as you give them the progressive economics. On the other hand, it turns out that downplaying the progressive economics loses everyone except the skilled professionals.The notion that a neoliberal vision of equality will enthuse Millennials and people of color is New Democrat myth. Simply being slightly to the left of the GOP on social issues isn’t enough.Advancing economic populism doesn’t mean deemphasizing the fight against racism, homophobia, or any other form of oppression. Movements from Justice for Janitors to the National Welfare Rights Organization have shown that an attention to the particular forms of domination (racism, sexism, etc.) can strengthen a universal class politics, and vice versa.What the Left must guard against is the devolution of anti-oppression politics intopro-business“diversity”rhetoricandawkward pandering.The New Democrats fashioned “a strain of corporate-friendly liberalism that deploys identity-based critiques of class politics as tools for obscuring the divergent material interests of rich and poor Democrats,” asNew Yorkmagazine’s Levitz ablysummarized. For example, while Hillary Clinton’s campaign hadmuchto say about the value of women in political office and corporate boardrooms, it had little to say about the plight of the poor single mothers that the Clintons’ welfare reform bill pushed further into poverty. Clinton’s feminism was “trickle-down-feminism,” asDissent’s Sarah Jaffedubbedit.In order to move beyond the New Democrats’ failed strategy, the party must combine social justice with economic populism. It must, for example, adopt aleft feminist politicsfocused on “rethinking the length of the workday, socializing child care, decoupling Social Security and health insurance from employment, and returning to the welfare rights movement’s call for a guaranteed minimum income.”Workers of all colors want a more progressive economic vision.Onalmosteveryeconomicissue, from spending on the poor to labor unions to health insurance, larger percentages of blacks and Latinos than whites hold left-leaning views. What Clinton lacked, Belcher’s focus groupsshowed, was a message that went beyond slamming Trump as a racist. Many black Millennials were looking for a positive agenda around issues like criminal justice reform and economic justice, not just criticism of Trump. And as political scientists Keith Gaddie and Kirby Goidelfound, “working class whites are more supportive of government guaranteeing jobs and income and, in general, of equalitarian values than other whites.”Large majorities of non-college-educated Americans say that Washington DC doesn’t represent their views and that they have too little influence over politics. They think that the government does too much to help the wealthy — more than say that the government does too much to help the poor or “racial and ethnic minorities” combined.Government action to attack rising economic inequality, including raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations, isoverwhelminglypopularwith both Democrats and Independents. The percentage of the public that believes hard work leads to success has fallen nearly 15 percent in the last fifteen years. More than 70 percent of Americansagreethat “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.” A majority regards both prosperity and poverty as the result of forces beyond an individual’s control.In order to move beyond the New Democrats’ failed strategy, the party must combine social justice with economic populism.A labor union rally in Indianapolis on March 10, 2011. Dennis Leonardo / FlickrThe least financially secure Americans are the most likely to support progressive economic policies. But they also have the least coherent political views, are the least politically engaged, and the least likely to vote. Many see no point in participating in a political system they justifiably dismiss astiltedtoward the rich. They’ll continue to sit it out if Democrats don’t change their tune.A progressive politics that fails to link racism and class is just as doomed to fail. “The progressive movement,” Ian Haney-López and Heather McGheeargue, “should expand from a vision of racism as violence done solely to people of color to include a conception of racism as a political weapon wielded by elites against the 99 percent, nonwhite and white alike . . . [and should] take up the race conversationwith white voters, by directly addressing racial anxiety and its role in fueling popular support for policies that hand over the country to plutocrats.”This connection, they note, does not “equate the harms to whites and to people of color done by racism.” Rather, it makesclearto audiences of all hues what they have at stake in fighting racism. “To enlist many whites in the battle against racism,” Haney-Lópezwrites, “requires demonstrating to whites that by voting according to dog whistle appeals, they’re wrecking their own lives — their work conditions and wages, their pensions, their health care, the education and future of their children.”The most powerful messagetestedby Greenberg’s polling outfit in 2014 was one that “linked big donations to politicians advancing the interests of wealthy donors who used unlimited, secret money to make sure that billionaires’ and CEOs’ taxes remained artificially low and their loopholes stayed protected.” Most importantly, hearing that argument before proposals for a more activist role in the economy made respondents more receptive to the latter.“[W]hite working-class and downscale voters,” Greenberg writes, “are acutely conscious of the growing role of big money in politics and of a government that works for the 1 percent, not them.” Despite their support for many progressive policies, they are “only ready to listen when they think that Democrats understand their deeply held belief that politics has been corrupted and government has failed.”Without offering a positive vision that addresses voters’ substantive concerns, neither the expansion of white-collar work nor an increasing percentage of people of color will give Democrats the majorities they need to win.Contrary to the implications of both the “working-class authoritarianism” thesis and much New Democratic rhetoric, the rise of the service economy hasn’t led to the embourgeoisement of the working class. Approximately 70 percent of the countrylacksa bachelor’s degree, and these Americans are aslikelyto work in white-college jobs as blue-collar ones. Many white-collar jobs are in the low-wage service sector, and even more professional white-collar workers are experiencing proletarianization of white-collar work.“[P]rofessionals have increasingly found their work subject to the dictates of insurance companies, entertainment conglomerates and other large institutions that have imposed a bottom-line mentality,” Judispointed outin 2002. “As a result, professionals have become increasingly inclined to distinguish their priorities from those of the market and of large corporate interests.”Though they’re supposedly a generation defined by college education and white-collar jobs, a majority of Millennialsidentifyas working class, while only 35 percent identify as middle class — the lowest of any generation. Both young Americans as a whole and young working-class whites, inparticular, hold vastlymore progressiveviews onbotheconomic and socialissuesthan their older counterparts.Withineducation groups, lower-income whites vote more Democratic, while higher-income whites vote more Republican. This pattern was visible in Clinton’s loss. Her biggestgainsamong college-educated whites came with those making more than $200,000 per year; she actually won fewer college-educated whites making less than $30,000 than Obama did in 2012.Likewise, treating non-white racial groups as monoliths in a “rising American electorate” obscures crucial class fault lines.The same sense of group competition for economic resources and social status thatmotivatedsome working-class whites to vote for Trump cuts across racial lines. On measures of support for racial and ethnic diversity, the differences between non-college whites and non-college blacks and Latinos are often moremutedthan one might expect. For example, 38 percent of non-college whites say diversity is “harmful because some people feel like they no longer belong,” along with 38 percent of non-college blacks and 31 percent of non-college Latinos. Like whites, African Americansworryabout competing with Latino immigrants for jobs, and blacks aremore likelyto believe negative stereotypes about Latinos and oppose extending services to Latinos if they feel that Latinos are surpassing African Americans socially and economically.While it’s hard to imagine African Americans deserting the Democratic Party anytime in the near future, thanks to the GOP’s overt anti-black racism, the same can’t be said about Latinos.Many pundits adopted areductionistcaricature of Latino voters, assuming that immigration was the only issue that mattered to them. Despitepredictionsthat Trump’s rhetoric would usher in an era in which Latinos would give Democrats “routine and overwhelming support,” Trump quitepossiblydidbetteramongLatinos than Romney did in 2012. At the very least, a Trump-induced exodus to the Democratic Partyfailedto materialize.What these predictions overlooked is that many Latino Americans, particularly those whose families have been in the US for more than two generations,believeillegal immigration is bad for the country.Researchalsoshowsthat many Latinos harbor negative stereotypes about African Americans, particularly when they live in the same neighborhoods as blacks.Even in his most inflammatory statements about Mexican “rapists,” Trump attempted to differentiate “hard-working” Latino citizens from undocumented immigrants, a rhetorical move redolent of longstanding conservative rhetoricseparatingthe “deserving” from the “undeserving” poor.Just as Irish and Southern and Eastern European immigrants “became white” in the early twentieth century by setting themselves apart from African Americans, more Latinos are nowself-identifyingas white, and those white-identified Latinos are more likely to support the GOP.It’spossible(ifunlikely) that Latinos will “become white” en masse.More than this, however, socioeconomic and ideological differences among Latinos should not be ignored. In 2012, ObamawonLatinos with a high school degree or less by forty points, but those with at least some college education by only ten points.In part, that’s because well-off Latinosholdmany policy views that are remarkably similar to those of well-off whites — that is to say, conservative ones. From the 1940s through the 1980s,fewclass differences existed when it came to the economic or social policy views of either Latinos or African Americans. But since the 1980s, well-off Latinos and well-off African Americans have pulled away from their poorer counterparts and embraced more conservative views on issues like government spending on the poor.And the GOP will undoubtedly continue to try to exploit class divisions among Latinos.Demographics, in other words, won’t save Democrats.The Path ForwardIn the crudest terms, politics is about winning elections, then enacting policies that empower your base and secure your political advantage. For more than forty years, the GOP has followed this model almost flawlessly.Republican presidential candidates win elections by running as “compassionate conservatives” anddownplayingormisrepresentingtheirunpopularpositions (particularly on entitlement programs). Once in office, they enact policies thatenrichtheir donor base andunderminethe unions, liberal interest groups, and social programs that empower the Democratic base.Democrats have taken the opposite route. In order to placate upper-income white moderates and appeasetheircorporatedonors, Democrats oftencapitulate to— orparticipate in— Republican attacks on their own base.Since the post-McGovern triumph of neoliberalism, the Democratic Party has offered little to workers and the poor but calls for “opportunity.” Even President Obama, who focused on inequality more than any post-LBJ Democrat, refused to break free from the “opportunity” framework. He spurned a potential economic adviser simply because she’d once used the word “redistribution,” and in his inequality-focused Osawatomie speech, he stopped short of championing equality, instead vowing to make “sure that everyone in America gets a fair shot at success.”Likewise, the “Great Gatsby Curve,”releasedin June 2013 to great fanfare by Obama’s CEA chair Alan Krueger, saw inequality only through the prism of opportunity, arguing that heightened inequality made it harder for families to move up the economic ladder across generations. All too often, the Obama White House focused on inequality only as a contributing factor to another problem, be it lowsocial mobilityor sloweconomic growth. But a progressive vision that fails to see all forms of inequality as injustices in and of themselves is no progressive vision at all.While the Obama administration made some gains in reducing inequality — particularly compared to other post-1960s presidents — most of the redistribution occurred as a result of the ACA’s shifting of income from the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans to the bottom 20 percent of Americans. Little of the redistribution reached Americans above the fortieth percentile — meaning that the main policy changes undertaken during Obama’s presidency failed to unite the poor with the working and middle classes.As the administrationitself admitted, Obama’s policies countered only “roughly one-tenth of the increase in the share of after-tax income accruing to the top 1 percent over the last three decades.” The bottom 95 percent of Americans still have a smaller share of after-tax income than they did in 1979.For decades, Democrats have crafted policies that favor complex “nudges,” “kludges,” and “market-based solutions.” They’ve hoped that funneling progressive programs through the tax code instead of setting up new programs would curb conservative opposition.Yet not only have such strategies failed to blunt the GOP’s attacks on the welfare state, they’ve also created what political scientist Suzanne Mettler has dubbed the “submerged state.” By shrouding government largesse in layers of complexity, Democratshave made it seemthat such benefits are natural, rather than the product of state intervention. As a result, the recipients of this “hidden welfare state” are neither grateful to the politicians or party who enacted the programs nor committed to defending them against conservative attacks.Take the Affordable Care Act. Fearing cries of “big government” and fights with insurance companies, Democrats embraced a mandate-and-subsidy model with roots in the conservative opposition to Bill Clinton’s market-based health reform plan. The ACA is popular among low-income Americans — including low-income whites — who have benefited from the Medicaid expansion and the most generous subsidies. But the working- and middle-class Americans who benefit from its other, more complex, provisions oftenfail to realizeit.That’s because the ACA represented an attempt at redistribution within, rather than between, classes, shifting costs from the younger and the healthier to the older and the sicker. The bottom 20 percent of the populationbenefited significantly, while the rest of the population saw little improvement. Bettering the lives of the poor is of course a laudable goal, but doing so through a maze of market incentives, regulations, and tax subsidies, rather than a universal program, is a recipe for political unpopularity.As Matt Bruenig hashighlighted, the structure of the ACA generates “enormous resentment.” Working-class people just above the Medicaid eligibility cutoff see poor people just below them getting better, cheaper coverage. Indeed, because of the means-tested nature of many tax credits, Medicaid is not the only program that seemsdesignedto stoke working-class resentment at those just barely poorer than them. This dynamic isn’t unique to the ACA. Rather, it’s inherent to all mean-tested programs.With the ACA, the Democrats took ownership of the country’sfailedmodelof for-profit health insurance. Once the public option went by the wayside, the ACA became something closer to an “Insurance Industry Profit Protection and Enhancement Act,” as former health insurance executive Wendell Potterquipped, than to a universal health care bill. In the minds of many Americans, the ACA’s salient feature is the individual mandate, which forces them to purchase a product from a private company that always seems to be getting more expensive.While the GOP’s attempts to repeal Obamacare have failed and boosted the law’s popularity, its flaws remain — and Republicans are hell-bent onexacerbatingthem and sticking Democrats with the blame.Time and time again, Americans have shown their willingness todefendsimple, universal programs even when, as with Social Security, they’re funded byregressivetaxes. Democrats must embrace a universal, social-democratic model of social provision, whether in the form of single-payer health care, national child care, or guaranteed jobs. Not only are such programs more popular and politically durable, they’re also harder to tilt toward the well off — which is exactly what the GOP hasdonewith the “submerged state” of tax subsidies.New universal programs won’t be feasible, however, until Democrats give up the canard of “fiscal responsibility.” For more than thirty years, Republicans have beenplayingDemocrats for budgetary fools. Each time Democrats have pursued austerity, they’ve ended up clearing fiscal space for a subsequent GOP tax cut for the rich. Carter’s “fiscal responsibility” underwrote Reagan’s top-heavy tax cut — and then Clinton and Obama made the same mistake.Democrats’ priority must be to expand existing entitlements and introduce new ones. If the deficit balloons, the debate will then be whether to solve it with higher taxes on the rich or cuts to popular programs. That’s a debate they can win.Beyond pursuing universal programs — which will give uncommitted or unenthused workers of all races a reason to go to the polls — Democrats must push policies that will grow their potential base. As studiesdemonstrate, labor unions are a proven tool for shaping members’ opinions on a wide variety of issues. Unions also provide a key non-corporate source of campaignfunding,mobilizetheir members for broader progressivecauses and policies, and, most importantly,shifteconomicpowerdownward. A meaningful working-class politics without organized labor is a contradiction in terms.The headquarters of UNITE HERE’s Culinary Union Local 226. Peter O’Dowd / WBURFrom the CIO unions of the 1930s to the Memphis sanitation workersstrikeof 1968 to the Las Vegas Culinary Union today, unions at their best have melded the universal with the particular, fighting for economist justice while battling more specific forms of oppression. And the more oppressed the population, the more valuable unions tend to be. A study by sociologists Jake Rosenfeld and Meredith Kleykampfoundthat unions disproportionately boosted the wages of African Americans and that “black-white weekly wage gaps would be between 13% and 30% lower if union representation remained at [the] high levels [of the 1970s].”Democrats’ support for left-leaning groups must go beyond unions, too. For decades, the GOP hasworkedto put one progressive organization after another — from ACORN to Planned Parenthood — on the defensive. Too often, as in the case of ACORN, Democrats have capitulated. But groups like ACORN and Planned Parenthood are central to mobilizing Democratic voters.A stronger social movementmentalityand continued base mobilization is Democrats’ only hope for durable electoral and policy success.Finally, and relatedly, Democrats must come to understand what the GOP already does: demobilizing your opponents’ base is as important as mobilizing yours.In their pursuit of well-off whites, neoliberal Democrats have often aided groups that ultimately side with the GOP. Both Carter and Clinton cut taxes on capital gains, Clinton deregulated the financial sector, and Obama famously treated Wall Street with kid gloves after it wrecked the economy. The Democrats’ reward for kowtowing to finance has been to watch Wall Street return to the GOP fold whenever convenient —includingfollowing Trump’s victory.Instead of keeping taxes on the rich low and regulation on business light in a futile attempt to out-GOP the GOP, Democrats should work to curb the economic and political power of corporations and the well-off at every turn. Rather than stoking economic growth and elevating wages, low taxes on upper incomes have onlyboostedinequality andhandedmoney to the rich that they’ve turned around and used tolobbyfor even more regressive, capital-friendly policies.Ultimately, Hillary Clinton’s defeat can’t be attributed to the moral failings of the white working class or the political savvy of Donald Trump, but to the utter failure of neoliberals’ strategy. For too long, Democrats have privileged well-off whites over the needs of the multiracial working class.If Democrats want to have a chance going forward, they’ll have to throw out the DLC playbook.\n",

Last June, progressive journalist John Judisarguedthat the “rage” that fueled Sanders’s candidacy was a reaction to “the failure of New Democrat politics to deliver prosperity or economy security.” “Clinton and the Democrats in Washington don’t understand the level of anxiety that Americans, and particularly the young, feel about their economic prospects,” he wrote.', 'In Detroit’s Wayne County, for example, Clinton received nearly eighty thousandfewervotesthan Obama in 2012 — more than seven times her loss margin in the entire state — while Trump received only fifteen thousand more than Romney.The story was the same in Wisconsin’s Milwaukee County, where Clinton\\xa0picked up forty thousand fewer votes than Obama in 2012, and Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County, where turnout in black precincts wasdown11 percent from four years earlier.', 'African-American voters didn’t show up in the same numbers there either.Simply put, Clinton not only lost the votes of many non-college-educated whites — she alsofailedto energize voters of color and young people.Zombie New DemocratsDespite Clinton’s shocking and disastrous loss, the message Democrats could take from 2016, if the neoliberals have their way, is that the partyshould“double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and college-educated white voters who were the main target of Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” Indeed, in the aftermath of the election, many punditscalledfor Democrats to fully write off non-college-educated whites and focus on flipping even more college-educated whites.The New America Foundation’s Lee Drutman hasencouragedDemocrats to work on making the party a coalition of “highly educated professional whites, especially women, and minority voters,” which he summarizes as the Obama coalition but with “even more of a role for wealthy cosmopolitans” and an even greater focus on “fiscal responsibility,” “international responsibility,” and “global businesses.” (Of course, this same logic led Drutman topredictlast March that Clinton would beat Trump and Democrats would take the Senate, since Clinton’s economic moderation would allow Democrats to “pick up enough moderate Republicans to more than compensate” for any lost “working-class votes.”)Predictably, DLC retreads have blamed Clinton’s defeat on economic populism and, indirectly, on Bernie Sanders. “The campaign with Bernie Sanders shifted the debate toward statist and redistributive solutions and not enough about how we’re going to make the economy grow and make government work better,” Will MarshalltoldtheNew Republicin a post-election interview.The DLC’s Al From sang the same tune.', 'It’s the strategy that caused Democrats to back trade deals that put downward pressure on the wages of blue-collar workers of all races, while exempting white-collar workers from the same competition.

What lessons will the Democrats learn from their losses in the House, their near-failure to capture the working Senate majority required to pass any meaningful progressive legislation over the next two years, and their forfeiture of multiple state legislative chambers leading up to a crucial redistricting year? And what are the implications of the Democrats’ internal postmortem for progressive electoral politics? While not written to anticipate the contours of post-2020 Democratic politics, Seth Masket’s masterfulLearning From Loss: The Democrats, 2016–2020provides a wealth of useful insights for understanding the Democrats’ likely trajectory over the coming years, as well as the strategic decisions progressives must grapple with as they seek to expand their influence on Democratic Party politics.First,Learning From Lossmakes a forceful case that the Democratic Party is both better organized and, paradoxically, more porous than most commentators on the progressive left allow. In particular, Masket argues that Biden’s victory in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary had much less to do with a concerted effort by Democratic leaders to tip the scales against progressives, and much more to do with a hyperfocus on electability among the party’s base, combined with a powerful (if empirically questionable) assumption that progressive presidential candidates are simply not electable. These findings should cast serious doubt on claims that progressives are structurally incapable of wielding influence within, or even taking control of, the Democratic Party, even as the medium-term prospects of doing so appear weaker in light of the 2020 election results.Next, Masket makes a series of important contributions to understanding the legacy and potential future of the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party. Through a detailed analysis of Democratic donor patterns and candidate staff reshuffling between 2016 and 2020, he shows that, although the democratic socialist faction of the party was unable to expand its 2016 ranks significantly in 2020, it has become a distinct and stable force within the party that is not likely to dissipate in the near future. At the same time, however, Masket’s findings suggest that there is no obvious path forward for Sanders’s coalition to meaningfully expand its ranks within the party over the coming years (at least not outside of heavily progressive areas of the country). This poses a major challenge to democratic socialists in Congress and in state legislatures who have experienced impressive gains in recent years (including in 2020) but who appear to be edging ever closer to a relatively low electoral ceiling.Joe Biden and Sen.

(Drew Angerer / Getty Images)Finally, Masket’s rich analysis of Democratic Party activists’ interpretation of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss offers insight into the debates we are likely to see unfold within the party over the coming months and years: Was the Democrats’ weak showing in 2020 a product of poor campaign strategy and messaging (particularly around identity politics), poor candidate selection, exogenous factors related to COVID-19 and the accompanying economic and health crises, or some combination of these factors? To what extent will party activists reevaluate previously held assumptions about the relative competitiveness of progressive candidates against centrist candidates, white male candidates against female candidates and candidates of color, and campaign strategies targeted to working-class voters, voters of color, and wealthy suburban constituencies within the party?Learning From Losssuggests that post-2020 intraparty debates are likely to mirror — and ultimately produce a similar outcome to — the party’s post-2016 debates. The party will remain highly risk-averse and will have few incentives to update its post-2016 belief that centrist candidates tailored to the median white suburban voter remain the key to party success. I close this essay with reflections on the strategic liabilities of repeating the lessons learned in 2016, which are based on the assumption that any progressive messaging is a political liability for Democrats in red and purple states. To the contrary, I suggest that economic populism remains a potentially powerful, if largely untested, strategy — not only for progressive success but also for Democratic Party success writ large.Sanders Wasn’t Robbed, He Just LostLearning From Losssets out to explain how the Democrats’ collective assessment of Clinton’s 2016 loss set the stage for, and in many ways determined the course of, the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. Its core thesis, based on a range of survey evidence and interviews with Democratic Party activists between 2017 and 2020, is that post-2016 political conditions significantly increased the likelihood that a candidate like Joe Biden would end up securing the nomination. Contrary to many analysts on the progressive left, Masket makes a strong case that Biden’s victory over Sanders was not the result of a concerted effort by party insiders to stop a democratic socialist insurgency. In fact, he argues that conditions within the party in 2020 were as amenable to outsider challenges as perhaps they ever had been.Even before March, the party base had largely decided both that Sanders was their least preferred candidate and that Biden was an acceptable alternative.Masket identifies three factors that made the Democratic Party in 2020 more favorable to Sanders than in 2016. First, Sanders’s capacity for successful fundraising based almost entirely on small-dollar donations significantly limited large donors’ and party elites’ control over the primary process. Second, the role of superdelegates was weakened compared to past primaries — in large part thanks to reforms insisted on by Sanders and his allies in the wake of the 2016 primaries. Further, Masket points out that, far from attempting to reign in such reforms, Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Tom Perez was excoriated by Sanders opponents who accused him of pushing too hard in the direction of Sanders-friendly reforms. In short, the party took all realistic steps possible to ensure the 2020 playing field would be more even than in 2016. Finally, the 2020 Democratic primary field included an unprecedented number of plausible mainstream candidates who served to split the primary vote, thereby increasing Sanders’s chance of victory.All that being said, however, Democrats did ultimately circle the wagons around Biden in early March 2020, demonstrating an impressive level of coordination and organizational strength. Was this, as many Sanders supporters have argued, evidence that the party was in control of the process all along and would never have let a candidate as far to the left as Sanders secure the nomination? Masket argues to the contrary, suggesting that two interrelated factors explain why Biden prevailed. In the first place, even before March, the party base had largely decided both that Sanders was their least preferred candidate and that Biden was an acceptable alternative to whoever they had initially supported in the primaries. In polls of Democratic primary voters, Sanders was consistently ranked as the most unpopular candidate in the field (i.e., the largest number of respondents reported that he was their least favorite candidate), while Biden consistently ranked as the most popular candidate (he was the top choice of the largest number of respondents)andthe least unpopular candidate. As a result, when it became clear that Sanders and Biden were the only two remaining viable candidates, it should not have come as a surprise to anyone that the rest of the party continued to dislike Sanders and opted to support Biden.Senator Bernie Sanders speaking at a campaign rally on March 1, 2020. (Wikimedia Commons)In turn, Democrats perceived the stakes of the 2020 election as being higher than any previous election in memory, making them particularly risk-averse during the nominating process. To drive this point home, Masket points out, for instance, that Donald Trump’s approval rating among Democrats was even lower than Barack Obama’s among Republicans. Further, in previous election cycles (and as recently as 2019), Democratic voters reported valuing policy congruence with candidates more highly than candidate electability. Democrats’ calculus of electability and policy congruence changed dramatically in 2020, as they viewed defeating Trump as a higher priority than any other objective. As Masket’s interviews with party activists show, many Democrats expressed a willingness to compromise on important policy goals in order to defeat Trump. In this context, Biden, viewed as the most electable candidate in the field by Democratic voters, had a major advantage over his rivals. This created an insurmountable obstacle for Sanders, whose explicitly democratic socialist ideology and far-left policy agenda were easy fodder for his opponents when trying to make the case that he was unelectable. Masket also shows how electability posed major challenges for other candidates, particularly female candidates and candidates of color, who are often perceived (erroneously) by voters as being more politically extreme and therefore less electable than white male candidates.Masket’s analysis of why Biden prevailed over Sanders has important strategic implications for progressive electoral politics. It helpfully dispels the notion that progressive, and even democratic socialist, insurgencies within the Democratic presidential primaries are doomed to failure by the supposed class character of the party. Sanders fought in 2020 on a relatively equal playing field — but, given the centrality of electability to voters and party activists, as well as the broadly held belief across the party that Biden was more electable, Sanders simply lost. That fact does not indicate that future progressive insurgents would meet the same fate under conditions where electability was less important in voters’ electoral calculus. Given the likelihood that electability will remain a top concern for Democratic voters in 2024 (especially if Trump seeks the presidency again), and since there will likely be strong support for vice president Kamala Harris’s candidacy if Biden does not stand for reelection, the short-to-medium-term prospects of insurgent success in the Democratic presidential primaries are limited. That said, there is little reason to conclude that progressives should abandon contests for power within the Democratic Party, even (and perhaps especially) at the national level.The Sanders Faction of the Democratic Party Will Endure, But It May Not GrowAnother important contribution to debates around progressive electoral strategy isLearning From Loss’s empirical demonstration that Sanders’s wing of the Democratic Party is a coherent faction that has sustained itself over multiple election cycles. A party faction,according to political scientist Daniel Silva, has four primary characteristics: ideological consistency, organizational capacity, persistence over time, and intent to affect a party’s political orientation.Clearly, the Sanders wing of the party is ideologically consistent (at least compared to other party factions) and intends to affect the Democrats’ political orientation. Masket explores whether it can also effectively influence a range of electoral contests, and if it has the capacity to do so over time. His analysis helps us to understand how likely the Sanders faction is to both endure and play an influential role in Democratic Party politics now that Sanders himself is no longer a candidate.Sanders’s failure to significantly expand the Democratic primary electorate among low-propensity working-class voters in 2020 makes attempts at a hostile takeover appear similarly unlikely.Masket finds clear evidence that the Sanders faction is enduring across election cycles as well as organizationally competent. To demonstrate factional endurance, he first examines donor data across the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.He finds that there was remarkable consistency in Sanders’s donor patterns. As shown in figure 1 below, among donors who gave in both the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, virtually none who gave to Sanders in 2020 were Clinton donors in 2016, and, with the exception of those who gave to Elizabeth Warren in 2020, the overwhelming majority of 2016 Sanders donors backed Sanders again in 2020. Warren, interestingly, drew more support from Sanders’s 2016 donors than from Clinton’s 2016 donors — but, given the perceived ideological affinity between Sanders and Warren among many Democratic voters, this is not particularly surprising.Figure 1.Candidate’s Share of Clinton Donors from 2016**The lower the number, the more the candidate drew from Sanders’s 2016 donors, and the higher the number, the more the candidate drew from Clinton’s 2016 donors. Source: Masket,Learning From Loss, 179.Masket next examines staffing patterns among 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, based on a data set consisting of 260 staffers who worked for Democratic presidential campaigns in both 2016 and 2020. He finds that, while Clinton’s 2016 staffers dispersed across the field of 2020 presidential candidates other than Sanders (with the plurality joining Warren’s campaign), the overwhelming majority of Sanders’s 2016 staffers (79 percent) returned to his 2020 campaign, with around 12 percent moving to Warren’s and a small handful shifting to other candidates.Masket finds not only that Sanders activists were consistent across election cycles but also that Sanders-aligned organizations — particularly Our Revolution — had a major impact on donation patterns in 2017–18 gubernatorial races. Specifically, in primaries where Our Revolution endorsed a gubernatorial candidate in 2017 or 2018, Sanders’s 2016 donors were 50 percentage points less likely than Clinton’s 2016 donors to support mainstream party candidates. He shows, additionally, that giving patterns of Sanders’s 2016 donors in 2017–18 contests changed significantly after Our Revolution endorsements were made. This indicates that the endorsements themselves, rather than Sanders supporters’ predisposition to self-select into progressive gubernatorial camps, drove 2017–18 donor patterns among Sanders’s 2016 supporters. Such evidence suggests that the Sanders faction has sufficiently strong organizational capacity to meaningfully influence Democratic primary politics in contests where Sanders himself is not a candidate.Yet the same evidence Masket offers to demonstrate the strength of the Sanders faction also points to important weaknesses. The Sanders faction’s experiences between 2016 and 2020 make it clear that a well-organized and ideologically consistent progressive minority faction can impact the contours of Democratic politics. This can be observed from a range of data points, from the emergence of Medicare for All and the Green New Deal as litmus test issues early in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, to Sanders supporters’ influence in the DNC’s 2017 Unity Reform Commission and the 2020 Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces. For this influence to translate into a successful presidential nomination, large blocs within Democratic legislative caucuses, or significant policy wins outside of heavily progressive states like New York, however, the faction will need to grow. To date, there is little evidence that the Sanders faction can surpass a significant but still relatively low ceiling of support within the Democratic Party. For instance, Sanders was extraordinarily unsuccessful at wooing 2016 Clinton donors in 2020, relying almost exclusively on his own 2016 donors to sustain his 2020 campaign. Further, consistent with Sanders’s polling numbers throughout the 2020 primary season, Masket’s donor data show that Sanders’s share of Democratic primary donors never surpassed 30 percent,and that, among strong Democratic partisans, he never reached 10 percent support.There are only two obvious paths to growth, and neither appears particularly likely, at least in the short term. On the one hand, the mutual hostility between the Sanders faction and the rest of the Democratic Party has made building allies within the party exceedingly difficult. On the other hand, Sanders’s failure to significantly expand the Democratic primary electorate among low-propensity working-class voters in 2020 makes attempts at a hostile takeover appear similarly unlikely. It is possible that a future progressive outsider candidate running in an election where electability is less salient could be more successful, but that would require either building stronger bridges to the rest of the party or offering a political program or campaign style that appeals more broadly to low-propensity voters who could make up for the candidate’s weakness among traditional Democrats.Lessons From 2016’s Loss Will Shape Democrats’ Response to 2020’s SetbacksI turn now to the broader implications ofLearning From Lossfor the future of Democratic Party politics. Masket’s analysis of post-2016 intraparty debates provides useful insights for understanding the party’s likely trajectory in the wake of its inevitable 2020 postmortem. In particular, he documents a widespread perception among Democratic Party activistsand Democratic primary votersthat Hillary Clinton was too focused on identity politics and unable to connect with white working-class voters, and that Clinton was a weak candidate, at least in part due to her gender. In turn, Masket conducted two survey experiments examining the extent to which exposure to identity politics narratives (narratives suggesting that identity politics are a political liability for Democrats) affects Democratic voters’ views of presidential nominees. With important differences across race and gender, Masket finds evidence that identity politics narratives make many Democrats less supportive of female candidates, candidates of color, and candidates supporting policies aimed at redressing group-specific inequities (such as combating workplace discrimination against women and people of color), while increasing their support for moderate white male candidates.Though he is careful to note that no consensus view emerged among Democrats to explain Clinton’s loss, Masket’s findings suggest that the combination of pervasive narratives around identity politics and a laser-like focus on electability convinced many Democrats that their best bet in 2020 was a “safe” candidate — specifically, a centrist white male candidate.Some voters may not trust Democrats’ progressive policy commitments because they associate Democrats with elite interests opposed to those of ordinary Americans.The results of the 2020 general election, as well as early reactions by Democratic politicians, suggest that similar dynamics willcharacterize intraparty debatesover the coming months and years.That is, the party’s strategic orientation in 2022 and 2024 will likely evince a similar logic to its post-2016 orientation. Biden’s victory, on the back of his remarkable success among suburban white voters — combined with his stronger showing compared to many (often more progressive) down-ballot candidates in red and purple states — is likely to confirm the wisdom of the party’s decision to nominate a centrist white male presidential candidate. This is especially likely given that electability will remain a central concern of Democratic voters in the post-Trump (and potentially future-Trump) era. To be sure, Biden’s choice of Kamala Harris as vice president, and his commitment to gender and racial diversity in his cabinet, demonstrate the competing pressures party leaders face to deliver for key constituencies in the Democratic coalition (especially women and African Americans). Overall, however, the 2020 election will likely be viewed by most Democrats as a vindication of the party’s risk-averse electoral strategy in 2020.Learning From Lossstudiously avoids the question of which post-2016 loss narratives were the most or least accurate. Indeed, Masket emphasizes that political science models of the election highlighting economic growth, international security, and party incumbencysuggested the electionwould be a toss-up.As a result, he cautions against placing undue causal weight on any contingent factors related to candidate characteristics or campaign messaging. Nonetheless, many of the intraparty debates sparked by Clinton’s loss remain central strategic questions for the party, and it is worth briefly considering their empirical merits in light of the Democrats’ (at best) disappointing electoral performance in 2020.For instance, Masket recounts debates between progressive members of the DNC’s 2017 Unity Reform Commission (tasked with proposing changes to the party’s rules and procedures that would address complaints raised by Sanders and his supporters during the 2016 presidential primaries) about the relative utility of focusing on bringing white working-class voters back into the Democratic coalition versus mobilizing people of color who did not turn out in 2016. With the dust settling from the 2020 presidential election, it is increasingly clear thatneitherof these strategies has been particularly effective. Indeed, despite impressive turnout gains in communities of color during the Georgia Senate runoff elections of January 5, 2021, Democrats’ most important support gains in 2018 and 2020 came from the ranks of affluent suburban voters. As figure 2 shows, across key battleground states, Biden’s advances over Clinton in wealthy suburban areas were consistently higher compared to areas with a large African American population.The implication is clear: not only are Democrats likely to believe they should double down on centrist candidates who can appeal most successfully to the median white suburban voter, but they appear to be objectively correct in that assessment. Yet, as many commentators have pointed out, the prevalence of split-ticket voting in the suburbs suggests that much of Biden’s support in these areas reflected a rejection of Trump, not an endorsement of Democrats. With Trump off the ballot in 2022 and potentially in 2024, will a red-state and purple-state strategy based on minimizing programmatic differences between the parties be enough to hold erstwhile conservatives in the Democratic fold? Beyond this, will the strategy be up to the task of defeating vulnerable Republican senators and defending the Democrats’ House margin in 2022, when it was barely able to do so in 2020 with Biden at the top of the ticket? Perhaps not — especially if Republicans can effectively weaponize connections between prominent members of the party’s left flank and centrists struggling to hold on in competitive congressional districts.Figure 2.Shift in Clinton − Biden Vote share by County Type (Counties where Biden outperformed Clinton)Source: Author’s calculations. Electoral data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections (uselectionatlas.org); demographic data from the American Community Survey.Despite these problems, it may be the case that Democrats simply have no promising strategic options in the short term, and that repeating the lessons learned from 2016 in the post-2020 period amounts to the least bad alternative. I want to suggest, however, that there is one approach the party has largely bypassed, and that such an approach might be an effective response to the supposed trade-off between progressive policy and electability explored inLearning From Loss. There issubstantial evidencethat candidates perceived by voters as being extreme tend to underperform candidates perceived as moderate, but it is less clear how voters’ perceptions of extremism vary across different policy positions and message framings offered by candidates.For instance, the results of Masket’s survey experiments suggest that many voters perceive progressive policies aimed at addressing group-based inequities as being more extreme than, say, a non-group-based policy to increase high-paying jobs through economic growth, and subsequently punish candidates who hold the more progressive position.While not tested in Masket’s experiments (since supporting economic growth is not an unambiguously progressive policy), a progressive economic policy platform presented in relatively neutral terms — and one that is relatable to different working-class constituencies (urban/rural, white/black/Latino) — could be perceived as less extreme compared to alternative progressive platforms.Consequently, such a platform could be more effective in appealing to disaffected white working-class voters as well as low-propensity working-class voters from all demographic groups. There is little doubt that large majorities of voters — including in red and purple states —supporta wide range of progressive economic policies, from free universal health care to a $15 minimum wage.Yet, as the decisive victory ofprogressive ballot initiativesin states carried easily by Trump in 2020 suggests, Democrats are not effectively translating these preferences into votes.Part of the explanation for this is likely attributable to the fact that many voters associate Democrats with progressive policies they perceive as less appealing than bread-and-butter economic policies. Alternatively, some votersmay not trustDemocrats’ progressive policy commitments because they associate Democratswith elite interestsopposed to those of ordinary Americans.A fascinating recent report on public opinion in rural America suggests that part of the Democrats’ problem reaching working-class voters lies in messaging and style. The report tests the appeal of different messaging frames on rural voters’ political preferences. It finds that,by relating progressive policy itemsto the experiences and values of working-class communities (in this case, rural communities), progressives might garner higher levels of support among constituencies they would otherwise struggle to reach — without losing support among their traditional base constituencies.Future research (and future electoral campaigns) are needed to better understand which types of policies and messaging frames can be deployed most successfully by progressive candidates among working-class voters, but there is reason to believe that the trade-off between progressive policy and electability may not be as stark as it is presented inLearning From Loss. Democrats in general, and progressives in particular, may yet have a path to electoral success in red and purple states that does not depend primarily on sustaining and growing their support among affluent suburban voters.\n",
            "relevant fragments: ['Right now, you cansubscribe to the print editionofCatalystfor just $20.Review ofLearning From Loss: The Democrats, 2016–2020, by Seth Masket (Cambridge University Press, 2020).Despite Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election and the Democrats’ razor-thin margin of control over the US Senate, the party’s underwhelming showing in down-ballot races\\xa0— both at the federal and state levels\\xa0— has put it on course for an internal reckoning. What lessons will the Democrats learn from their losses in the House, their near-failure to capture the working Senate majority required to pass any meaningful progressive legislation over the next two years, and their forfeiture of multiple state legislative chambers leading up to a crucial redistricting year?', 'In particular, Masket argues that Biden’s victory in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary had much less to do with a concerted effort by Democratic leaders to tip the scales against progressives, and much more to do with a hyperfocus on electability among the party’s base, combined with a powerful (if empirically questionable) assumption that progressive presidential candidates are simply not electable. These findings should cast serious doubt on claims that progressives are structurally incapable of wielding influence within, or even taking control of, the Democratic Party, even as the medium-term prospects of doing so appear weaker in light of the 2020 election results.Next, Masket makes a series of important contributions to understanding the legacy and potential future of the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party.', 'This poses a major challenge to democratic socialists in Congress and in state legislatures who have experienced impressive gains in recent years (including in 2020) but who appear to be edging ever closer to a relatively low electoral ceiling.Joe Biden and Sen.', 'Its core thesis, based on a range of survey evidence and interviews with Democratic Party activists between 2017 and 2020, is that post-2016 political conditions significantly increased the likelihood that a candidate like Joe Biden would end up securing the nomination.', 'Its core thesis, based on a range of survey evidence and interviews with Democratic Party activists between 2017 and 2020, is that post-2016 political conditions significantly increased the likelihood that a candidate like Joe Biden would end up securing the nomination. Contrary to many analysts on the progressive left, Masket makes a strong case that Biden’s victory over Sanders was not the result of a concerted effort by party insiders to stop a democratic socialist insurgency. In fact, he argues that conditions within the party in 2020 were as amenable to outsider challenges as perhaps they ever had been.Even before March, the party base had largely decided both that Sanders was their least preferred candidate and that Biden was an acceptable alternative.Masket identifies three factors that made the Democratic Party in 2020 more favorable to Sanders than in 2016.', 'In fact, he argues that conditions within the party in 2020 were as amenable to outsider challenges as perhaps they ever had been.Even before March, the party base had largely decided both that Sanders was their least preferred candidate and that Biden was an acceptable alternative.Masket identifies three factors that made the Democratic Party in 2020 more favorable to Sanders than in 2016. First, Sanders’s capacity for successful fundraising based almost entirely on small-dollar donations significantly limited large donors’ and party elites’ control over the primary process.', 'In short, the party took all realistic steps possible to ensure the 2020 playing field would be more even than in 2016. Finally, the 2020 Democratic primary field included an unprecedented number of plausible mainstream candidates who served to split the primary vote, thereby increasing Sanders’s chance of victory.All that being said, however, Democrats did ultimately circle the wagons around Biden in early March 2020, demonstrating an impressive level of coordination and organizational strength. Was this, as many Sanders supporters have argued, evidence that the party was in control of the process all along and would never have let a candidate as far to the left as Sanders secure the nomination?', 'Masket argues to the contrary, suggesting that two interrelated factors explain why Biden prevailed. In the first place, even before March, the party base had largely decided both that Sanders was their least preferred candidate and that Biden was an acceptable alternative to whoever they had initially supported in the primaries.', 'In the first place, even before March, the party base had largely decided both that Sanders was their least preferred candidate and that Biden was an acceptable alternative to whoever they had initially supported in the primaries.', 'In polls of Democratic primary voters, Sanders was consistently ranked as the most unpopular candidate in the field (i.e., the largest number of respondents reported that he was their least favorite candidate), while Biden consistently ranked as the most popular candidate (he was the top choice of the largest number of respondents)andthe least unpopular candidate. As a result, when it became clear that Sanders and Biden were the only two remaining viable candidates, it should not have come as a surprise to anyone that the rest of the party continued to dislike Sanders and opted to support Biden.Senator Bernie Sanders speaking at a campaign rally on March 1, 2020.', 'As a result, when it became clear that Sanders and Biden were the only two remaining viable candidates, it should not have come as a surprise to anyone that the rest of the party continued to dislike Sanders and opted to support Biden.Senator Bernie Sanders speaking at a campaign rally on March 1, 2020. (Wikimedia Commons)In turn, Democrats perceived the stakes of the 2020 election as being higher than any previous election in memory, making them particularly risk-averse during the nominating process.', 'To drive this point home, Masket points out, for instance, that Donald Trump’s approval rating among Democrats was even lower than Barack Obama’s among Republicans.', 'Democrats’ calculus of electability and policy congruence changed dramatically in 2020, as they viewed defeating Trump as a higher priority than any other objective.', 'Democrats’ calculus of electability and policy congruence changed dramatically in 2020, as they viewed defeating Trump as a higher priority than any other objective. As Masket’s interviews with party activists show, many Democrats expressed a willingness to compromise on important policy goals in order to defeat Trump. In this context, Biden, viewed as the most electable candidate in the field by Democratic voters, had a major advantage over his rivals.', 'In this context, Biden, viewed as the most electable candidate in the field by Democratic voters, had a major advantage over his rivals.', 'Masket also shows how electability posed major challenges for other candidates, particularly female candidates and candidates of color, who are often perceived (erroneously) by voters as being more politically extreme and therefore less electable than white male candidates.Masket’s analysis of why Biden prevailed over Sanders has important strategic implications for progressive electoral politics.', 'Sanders fought in 2020 on a relatively equal playing field — but, given the centrality of electability to voters and party activists, as well as the broadly held belief across the party that Biden was more electable, Sanders simply lost.', 'Given the likelihood that electability will remain a top concern for Democratic voters in 2024 (especially if Trump seeks the presidency again), and since there will likely be strong support for vice president Kamala Harris’s candidacy if Biden does not stand for reelection, the short-to-medium-term prospects of insurgent success in the Democratic presidential primaries are limited. That said, there is little reason to conclude that progressives should abandon contests for power within the Democratic Party, even (and perhaps especially) at the national level.The Sanders Faction of the Democratic Party Will Endure, But It May Not GrowAnother important contribution to debates around progressive electoral strategy isLearning From Loss’s empirical demonstration that Sanders’s wing of the Democratic Party is a coherent faction that has sustained itself over multiple election cycles.', 'The Sanders faction’s experiences between 2016 and 2020 make it clear that a well-organized and ideologically consistent progressive minority faction can impact the contours of Democratic politics.

You can noworder a copy of this important new bookdirect fromJacobinfor only $10, with free shipping.It’s like we’ve divided the country into pieces. How can we be one America if we continue down this road?—Joe Biden on reaching across the aisle, January 2019.It was only three months after the Democratic Party’s 2010 electoral “shellacking” when Vice President Joe Biden found himself in Kentucky keynoting a conference about the US Senate. There were few people better qualified to talk on the subject: Biden had spent virtually his entire adult life in the body and was one of the most outspoken proponents of its culture of chummy dealmaking. Topics ranged from its foundations and evolution to the influence of antebellum political giant Henry Clay, “The Great Compromiser” who had staved off civil war through a series of famed bargains that also had the effect of extending the life of slavery.Biden was on enemy territory. He was speaking at the behest of the University of Louisville’s McConnell Center, which, like the Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium on whose third floor he prepared to deliver his remarks, drew its name from the source of its corporate funding: Mitch McConnell, Kentucky’s longest-serving senator, who had ascended to the Senate Republican leadership over a twenty-six-year-long career founded on his unparalleled ability to raise money from powerful interests. McConnell, who would be speaking alongside Biden, was also the chief architect of the “shellacking” Biden’s party and administration had just received.Only two years earlier, with another charismatic figure as their nominee and popular rage against the Bush administration further inflamed by the worst financial crash since the 1930s, the Democrats had swept to a level of domination in Washington not seen for thirty years, fueling talk of the GOP as a “permanent minority” party. Behind closed doors, Republican leaders plotted to reverse each Democratic gain by 2012 through an aggressive united front of opposition to each and every move the new administration made.Admitting that his single-biggest priority was making Biden’s boss a “one-term president,” McConnell spent the next two years leading a historic campaign of obstruction in the Senate against the Obama agenda. This meant rejecting the hallowed Washington tenets of compromise and bipartisanship, forcing the Democrats to cobble together sixty-vote, party-line majorities for every measure, and using his knowledge of Senate procedure to slow legislation down. In the process, McConnell whittled down the administration’s economic stimulus proposal to, after accounting for inflation, the smallest such measure in thirty years. And he blocked further measures to boost jobs and the economy that Republicans had once advocated, sabotaging economic recovery. The coup de grâce was a December 2010 deal McConnell had personally struck with Biden to howls of outrage from Democrats, trading thirteen more months of unemployment insurance at a time of nearly double-digit joblessness for a host of more permanent giveaways to the wealthy.Biden’s fifty-minute speech the following February painted things differently, however. As McConnell looked on, Biden warmly paid tribute to the man who had devoted the last two years to smothering his administration’s agenda. He stressed his oft-repeated refrain that you couldn’t question someone’s motives in politics, only their judgment. He pointed to their deal as “the only truly bipartisan event that occurred in the first two years of our administration,” proof that “the process worked.” And he reminded the audience about the essential unity of those who ran the government: whether they were liberal or conservative, Tea Party or Blue Dog, “they all ran for office because they love their country.”“We basically all agree on the nature of the problems we face,” he concluded.Biden’s comments were dubious by the standards of anyone who had lived through the preceding two years. For someone who had served in Congress through the tumultuous Clinton and Bush years, they were delusional. While Republicans responded to their electoral collapse two years earlier with a ruthless determination to defeat their opponents, take back power, and halt the leftward swing in political momentum that was expected to follow the election, Democrats seemed wedded to a hokey faith in the political values of a bygone era with a different Republican Party. It wasn’t that they were playing two entirely different ball games; Biden and Democrats like him didn’t even seem to know a game was being played.Biden’s continued faith in principles that his adversaries had long abandoned and his willingness to give it all away at the negotiating table made him the go-to contact for every one of McConnell’s future fiscal hostage scenarios. The inability of Biden and the administration to effectively push back would mean disaster, first in working Americans’ pocketbooks and then at the ballot box.The Throwback CandidateDespite giving himself an early start two-and-a-half years before the first primary, Biden knew winning in 2008 would be tough. He would almost certainly be running against Sen. Hillary Clinton, considered a lock for the nomination on the back of her fundraising prowess and influence within the party from her time as First Lady. And in many ways, he was a man out of time. “I may not be what the party’s looking for,” he said. “I may be too ‘muscular’ on foreign policy. I may not be ‘pure’ enough about abortion rights. I may not have been ‘energetic’ enough about gay marriage.”That socially conservative streak he alluded to was now an especially big liability. Once upon a time, Biden’s “nuanced” position on abortion rights — drawn at least partly from his Catholic upbringing — had marked him as a frustrating but fascinating renegade among Democrats. Telling a reporter in 1974 that he disliked theRoe v. Wadedecision because “I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body,” he eventually settled on what he called “the only consistent position intellectually, which is that if you say government should be out, then government should be out.”With this as his guiding light, Biden cast a decade’s worth of votes that turned into political boomerangs. Though opposing a 1974 constitutional amendment banning abortions — he didn’t have the right to force his beliefs on others, he explained — he backed measures barring federal money from being used “directly or indirectly to pay for or encourage” abortions, prohibiting poor women from using Medicaid to pay for the procedure, and forbidding federal workers from using their government health benefits to obtain one, something he voted for five times before it finally became law.Some measures had long-lasting legacies. Biden’s support for the 1976 Hyde Amendment secured a landmark anti-abortion triumph by barring federal funding of abortions, becoming so entrenched in subsequent years that abortion rights campaigners simply gave up on repealing it. His 1981 proposal to bar US aid from going to biomedical research related to abortion remains on the books to this day. Meanwhile, the Reagan-era “Mexico City policy” that Biden supported, also known as the “global gag rule” for its stringent blackballing of NGOs that so much ascounseledwomen on abortions, would be in place for nineteen of the next thirty-four years, rescinded by Democratic presidents and reinstated and toughened by Republican ones in a perpetual loop.Though striving for a middle-of-the-road position, Biden backed some extreme measures. He helped defeat a 1977 amendment to remove all restrictions on federal funding of abortions and voted instead for what thePhiladelphia Inquirercalled “the toughest ever anti-abortion measure,” one that extended that ban to even cases of incest and rape. He voted repeatedly to ban funding simply for abortion research and training. In what he called “the single most difficult vote I’ve ever cast as a US senator,” he defied his own guiding philosophy and became one of two Democrats to send out of committee the Hatch amendment, which would have overturnedRoe v. Wadeby letting either states or Congress decide the question of abortion — whichever was “more restrictive.”Unlike his appeasement of anti-busing groups, Biden weathered intense pressure from reproductive rights campaigners for taking such positions. Assuring constituents he had voted “more than twenty times” against abortion spending bills, he defied furious local representatives of groups like Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for Women (NOW), the ACLU, and even his own state’s task force on human reproduction, who demanded that he protect abortion rights. By the late 1980s, Biden had succeeded in angering everyone: both anti-abortion groups that vowed to defeat someone they saw as a turncoat and pro-choice groups like Planned Parenthood that complained he “usually votes against us,” with both sides accusing him of playing politics.These relationships were only further strained by Biden’s role in the battle over Reagan and Bush Sr’s Supreme Court nominees. Deemed an “anti-choice” lawmaker in 1987 by the liberal feminists of the National Women’s Political Caucus, Biden became a lightning rod for abortion-related blame, with abortion opponents complaining he wastooharsh to the Republican nominees and supporters more accurately grousing that he wasn’t toughenough. Biden’s failure to successfully challenge the nominees — particularly egregious in the case of Clarence Thomas and all the more so in the case of Anthony Kennedy — meant both justices would form part of the slim right-wing majorities delivering key anti-abortion rulings in the decades ahead. In the case of Kennedy, the opinion he coauthored in a 1992 case then celebrated for upholdingRoeactually weakened it, opening the floodgates to an assortment of crafty state laws that didn’t explicitly outlaw abortion but made it all but impossible.Thus by the 2000s, Biden seemed an awkward fit in a Democratic Party that had become markedly more liberal on social issues, even as it clung to the economically conservative philosophy it embraced under Reagan. Though Biden too had become more liberal on the issue, whatever political benefit he might have gained from this was undone in 2003, when, after voting repeatedly over the preceding eight years for a ban on so-called “partial-birth” abortions, he cast a vote that helped make the measure law under Bush Jr. When the Supreme Court controversially upheld the law in 2007 — a ruling celebrated by abortion foes as the “crack in the dike” that would eventually overturnRoe— Biden was not only the very last Democratic presidential candidate to issue a statement condemning it, doing so only at the prodding of his hometown paper, but he then told Democratic voters he made “no apologies” for his 2003 vote.As in 1987, bold, ambitious proposals would not be Biden’s selling point for his latest White House run. While North Carolina senator John Edwards centered lifting 37 million Americans out of poverty, Biden centered restoring America’s place in the world and — what else? — its middle class, with a platform that called for bringing troops home, repealing Bush’s tax cuts, and ending oil subsidies. As his rivals floated (with some nudging from unions) single-payer health care or even just a public health insurance program to compete with industry, Biden proposed a grab bag of laudatory but inadequate half-measures, the cornerstone of which was a government reinsurance pool to cover “catastrophic” health care costs over $50,000, which he bafflingly pitched on the stump by stressing the hardship of business owners with sick employees.Some of Biden’s measures were comically feeble. His affordable education plan covered half the tuition of a public four-year college and did so through every government-allergic neoliberal’s favorite bureaucratic instrument: tax credits. Deploring that “average Americans are really getting hung out to dry,” he proposed as one solution a special savings account for kids that the government would kick-start with a $500 contribution — which the students would have to pay back upon turning thirty. Meanwhile, Biden returned to the tough-on-crime well, proposing a law-enforcement hiring spree meant to build on his 1994 legislation — even though violent crime had nearly halved since 1990.If his ideas fell short of the challenges at hand, it’s because Biden believed the biggest issue on voters’ minds was “security for their families, physical security,” and the ongoing Iraq War. But Biden’s attempt to cast himself as the safest pair of hands on foreign policy was plagued by the same vulnerability that hampered almost all of his rivals: his vote for said war.It was this more than anything — more so even than his charisma and electrifying speeches — that provided a wide-open lane for a young, first-term African American senator from Illinois named Barack Obama to ascend past Biden and the rest of the field and quickly establish himself as a front-runner. While Biden had led the march to war, Obama was on the record opposing it in a 2002 speech. By April 2007, in a poll asking the members of the progressive grassroots group MoveOn.org which candidate would best lead the country out of Iraq, Biden ended up second to last, with Obama, advocating a much speedier withdrawal, coming in first.Not helping were Biden’s frequent “gaffes.” Whether it was saying that “you cannot go into a Dunkin’ Donuts or 7-Eleven unless you have a slight Indian accent,” describing Obama as “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean,” or repeatedly invoking Delaware’s history as a “slave state” to make the case for his appeal to Southern voters — Delaware had only fought for the Union “because we couldn’t figure out how to get to the South,” he told one mostly Republican audience — it seemed like Biden couldn’t say anything without drawing a hail of justified criticism. What had passed for straight-shooting and candor in an America and a Democratic Party twenty years younger and far less diverse now came off as offensive, out of touch, and old-fashioned.With his number-one selling point neutralized, a lack of ambitious proposals dealing with Americans’ pressing material concerns, and no 1987-style youth appeal to paper over his deficiencies, Biden fell far behind Obama, Clinton, and several others in both fundraising and polling, even running second in his own state. Decrying the contest’s money chase as “obscene,” Biden desperately scrounged for lawyer and lobbyist cash to fill up his comparatively empty campaign coffers, having already missed one key debate on LGBTQ issues due to not being able to afford a private plane. He bet it all on a good showing in the first two contests, insisting to the press in the home stretch that his rivals’ support was soft and an upset was on the horizon.It was not to be. Despite a long list of endorsements, growing crowds, and swelling donations at the eleventh hour, Biden managed only 0.9 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses, placing fifth. Announcing the end of his campaign, a dejected Biden stood on stage with his tearful family and told the crowd, “I ain’t going away.” He had no idea how right he was.Mr Vice PresidentThere’s still no straight story of why exactly Obama chose Biden to be his vice president. It was “about adding foreign-policy credentials to the ticket,” said one Obamian; they needed someone to “go out and hammer that middle-class message”; he and Obama shared a chemistry missing with the other candidates; his age would preclude any future presidential ambitions and make for an easier relationship; Obama, fearing a backlash among white voters in the Rust Belt and Appalachia, wanted racial balance. Perhaps it was some mix of all five. “You are the pick of my heart, but Joe is the pick of my head,” Obama told one runner-up.For Biden, unwilling to take a job he saw as “stand-by equipment,” the calculus was much simpler. While he didn’t want the “quasi-executive” role of Bush’s vice president, he did want to be Obama’s closest adviser, the proverbial “last person in the room” for any decision the future president made. The two struck a deal, and on August 23, Obama introduced his running mate to the world at a rally in the Illinois capital of Springfield.Besides his chumminess with Wall Street and other industries, picking Biden should have been the first sign the Democratic nominee’s progressive bona fides weren’t quite as robust as he made them seem. But few knew Biden’s history, and what little they did know — his tough-on-crime history, his foreign policy record — the press viewed as strengths, floating only his “gaffes” and campaign-era criticism of Obama as potential problems.Obama’s charisma, apparent progressivism, inspiring calls for “change,” and the historic nature of his candidacy brought the long-dormant Democratic base to the polls, facing down one of the more racist Republican campaigns in modern memory, with its insinuations that Obama was a terrorist. Though total turnout remained unchanged from 2004, and Obama lost ground among older and Southern white voters, turnout among young voters, African Americans, Latinos, and Asians surged, handily giving Obama the edge in both the popular vote and Electoral College. This same coalition, coupled with disgruntled voters fed up with eight years of GOP rule, strengthened the Democrats’ control of Congress.As president, much of Obama’s job involved cleaning up messes that Biden had helped create. Most pressing was the 2008 financial crash. As Sen. Byron Dorgan had predicted a decade before, the repeal of Glass-Steagall, which Biden and virtually every other Democrat had voted for in 1999, while not the main cause of another Wall Street crash — that had been the product of predatory lending by the mortgage industry — nevertheless made the resulting crisis much more severe. Between 2007 and 2011, a quarter of American families lost at least 75 percent of their wealth; black families were hit particularly hard.Besides this, the list of tasks facing the administration was daunting. It had to stabilize the economy, prevent another crash from happening, deal with a festering health care crisis, extricate the United States from a set of disastrous wars, come to the rescue of underwater homeowners and otherwise struggling Americans, and fix an unjust and Kafkaesque immigration system, all while making as much progress on preventing a looming catastrophe in the form of climate change. It was a tall order.Yet despite an unprecedentedly pitiless campaign of right-wing opposition waged on the streets, over the air waves, and in the halls of power, the administration held the cards it needed. Obama, and by extension the Democrats who rode into Congress on his coattails, had been elected with an overwhelming public mandate. He stood at the head of a massive volunteer army ready to fight for his agenda. He and his party controlled not just the presidency but both houses of Congress; within six months, they would have a filibuster-proof supermajority, albeit a flimsy one, in the Senate. And as details about the greed and criminality of those who had wrecked the world economy trickled out, a bipartisan anger burned across the country.So what happened?Though Biden would have no compunction in later claiming Obama’s achievements as his own, he didn’t deserve the blame for every one of the administration’s failures any more than he did its successes. It was Obama’s presidency, and it was he who demobilized his volunteer army, who failed to prosecute Wall Street and capitalize on public anger at its greed, who went back on his pledge to end the wars and took Bush’s “war on terror” to new extremes, who declined to apply pressure to Democrats holding up his agenda, and who shied away from taking more radical steps to deal with an epochal crisis for fear of being labeled a “socialist,” something he had already been called incessantly long before winning an election.But despite an initially rocky start to their relationship, Biden’s status as “counselor in chief” meant he was deeply involved at the administration’s core. “Every single solitary appointment he has made thus far, I’ve been in the room,” he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos in December 2008. “And the recommendations I have made in most cases coincidentally have been the recommendations that he’s picked. Not because I made them but because we think a lot alike.”Taking Biden at his word, that means he had independently settled or signed off on the appointment of right-wing chief of staff Rahm Emanuel (Obama’s first appointment after Biden), Clintonite transition head John Podesta (who proceeded to staff the administration with neoliberals), tax-evading Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner (the architect of the bank-friendly bailouts and foreclosure program, which did nothing to help foreclosure victims), and neoliberal economist Larry Summers (“he’s the smartest son of a bitch,” Biden said). This isn’t to mention the staffing of the National Economic Council, the White House’s economic policy-making arm, with what one journalist called “a team of Rubins” — referring to Clinton treasury secretary and Citigroup executive Robert Rubin, the same one who had engineered the repeal of Glass-Steagall and who now had a direct influence on the administration through protégés like Geithner, who in return had engineered the bailout of Rubin’s bank.As Reed Hundt, a longtime Democratic insider who served on both Clinton and Obama’s transition teams, later wrote, these appointments all but guaranteed the administration’s economic failures. Each of these appointees systematically worked to shave down what progressive ambitions Obama had and limit his range of options — for example, by ruling out allowing bankruptcy judges to shrink homeowners’ mortgages. During one transition meeting, Biden piped up to tell this lopsided team that bailing out one side over another would be a mistake and that economic policy mustn’t pit Wall Street against “Main Street” — as if both of those hadn’t already happened, in Wall Street’s favor.When the administration did throw a lifeline to “Main Street,” it defined that term rather uniquely. Obama sought to placate his conservative critics by redirecting some of the 2008 bailout money not to underwater homeowners or debt-ridden workers but into loans for small businesses, which had already been lavished with tax breaks. “It’s high time we help Main Street,” Biden said about the measure, arguing that because small businesses were “the engine of employment,” funding them was the Main Street equivalent of the bank bailouts.At $30 billion, this supposed Main Street bailout was nowhere near the scale of the one that banks had gotten. Worse, a public struggling under the load of several different burdens — and already enraged and confused thattheywere paying to save the story’s villains, who then used that money to shower their executives with big salaries and bonuses before bouncing back to record profits within a few years — watched as their money once more went to help anyone but them. Adding insult to injury, after two years, only $4 billion of that “Main Street” lifeline had been spent, and 80 percent of that was used by the community banks who received it to pay off whatever bailout money they still owed the government.Meanwhile, on what would become Obama’s signature accomplishment — health care reform — Biden served as conservatizing force. Obama had already cut a backroom deal trading away the public option for support from the hospital industry, opting instead for a Republican-inspired health care plan he hoped would get bipartisan support. Though Biden loyally whipped Democratic votes for the bill and unsuccessfully wooed Republican “moderates” who signaled they might support such a version, Biden had urged Obama to abandon ship once it stalled in August 2009. Biden feared that, like Clinton’s doomed health care reform effort that he had been similarly unenthusiastic about, its failure would hobble the administration.Once signed into law —“a big fucking deal,” as Biden memorably told Obama on a hot mic — Biden had another objection: rules issued by the Health and Human Services secretary in 2011 mandating that even church-affiliated institutions like hospitals provide free contraception for women, which angered Catholic groups. The conflict pitted Biden and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops against a group of Obama’s mostly women advisers, Planned Parenthood, and a host of outraged Democrats.Though Biden lost, the episode revealed one important distinction between his and the president’s otherwise similar worldviews. Besides the fundamental moral question of securing a basic health care need for half the population, Obama and his advisers were taking care of a core constituency that had brought them victory in 2008. But Biden reportedly thought the rest of the administration was too focused on that coalition of women, African Americans, and Latinos; he saw himself as looking after the old New Deal coalition of blue-collar workers, senior citizens, and Catholics — apparently forgetting that African Americans had been an important part of that coalition or that women made up a growing share of the modern blue-collar workforce.One place Biden did provesimpaticowith the rest of the White House was on government spending. As one of his first official tasks as vice president, Obama made Biden caretaker of the nearly $800 billion economic stimulus that had just barely cleared the Senate in February 2009. Having spent the previous three decades as the Senate Democrats’ resident spendthrift, Biden took the role “extremely seriously,” an adviser said, tirelessly working to deter fraud and root out “waste” — a category that turned out to include any useful job-creating project that simply sounded like it might inspire right-wing criticism. The stimulus had come in for a lot of criticism already in part because Biden needlessly assured the press that “some of this money is going to be wasted” and “some people are being scammed already.” To show what would happen to recipients of stimulus funds who failed to file the necessary reports, Biden’s team chose to make an example of a nonprofit that provided food to hungry children, denying it any further funds as punishment.Biden’s work was such a success that it earned him the nickname “Sheriff” from Obama — and his appointment to its sequel: the Campaign to Cut Waste, launched two years later to “hunt down misspent tax dollars in every agency and department of this government,” in Obama’s words. In its first year alone, while the United States was estimated to be losing $337 billion a year from tax evasion, Obama touted the program’s savings of $17.6 billion.Before the transition even got going, Obama tasked Biden with “honchoing” a task force focused on arresting working Americans’ declining standard of living. Originally named the White House Task Force on Working Families, with Biden at the helm, the body at some point became the White House Task Force on theMiddle Class.With this narrowed objective, in 2010, Biden’s task force presented a grab bag of options “to make sure the middle class emerges from this recession able to grow stronger and more secure.” Defining middle-class families not by income (Obama had absurdly defined them as earning under $250,000 a year) but more as a state of mind (“defined by their aspirations,” which include taking vacations, owning a home and car, and getting their kids a college education), the task force’s proposals ran the gamut from expanded tax credits to a student loan overhaul that became law a month later.Another option was passing the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), also known as “card check,” with the task force report accurately noting that the decline of union power had fueled the stagnation of Americans’ wages. Card check would allow workers to unionize the way they do in much of the world — by getting a majority of workers to sign authorization cards instead of holding a vote. Obama had made this a key election promise as he campaigned in union-strong swing states, and unions had showered him with money and foot soldiers in return. Upon taking office, Obama dispatched Biden to assure nervous labor audiences that the bill, opposed by business groups to the tune of millions of dollars, would pass in the first year. “If a union is what you want, then a union is what you should get,” Biden told labor leaders.Had card check passed, it could have given flagging union membership a shot in the arm, with reverberating impacts beyond that: besides securing higher wages and better benefits for their members, strong unions had been historically key to progressive triumphs like the Civil Rights Movement. And in theory, Biden was exactly the person to make it happen. Besides his history with unions, Biden’s ability to work with Republicans and skill at leveraging his Senate relationships to get things passed had been a key selling point for Obama.At first, Biden seemed like he was working this patented magic, successfully cajoling centrist Republican senator Arlen Specter to switch parties by April. But Specter made clear that swapping the letter in front of his state didn’t mean he was dropping his opposition to card check, and he wavered only when the AFL-CIO pledged to back his reelection in 2010. Meanwhile, a handful of Democratic senators in red states began folding under an onslaught of corporate lobbying, which had recruited figures connected to the White House personnel who Biden had signed off on, such as John Podesta’s sister-in-law and brother. Biden had even gone down to Arkansas to campaign for one of the Democrats switching sides on card check: Blanche Lincoln. Biden helped Lincoln double her fundraising for reelection the following year, only for her to rebuff the administration on EFCA.By July 2009, Democrats had negotiated away the card check provision from the bill, and they then failed to pass even what remained. Obama, meanwhile, had long ceased talking about unions whatsoever in public, let alone card check, though he sent Biden to periodically assuage labor’s concerns. Not understanding its potential importance to his own agenda, the president was loath to spend precious political capital on something he didn’t consider a priority. By the time the bill turned up in Biden’s Task Force on the Middle Class report the next year, it was already dead and buried.Less than two years in, Obama could claim several major achievements, including a stimulus that saved the economy from further collapse, health care reform that had eluded generations of presidents, and a regulatory overhaul of Wall Street. But the social reforms many liberal voters had expected didn’t materialize, and his choice of economic advisers, his less-than-aggressive pursuit of Wall Street criminality and economic security, plus the built-in delay in the impact of the measures he did achieve made economic recovery anemic to nonexistent for many Americans.Biden had little sympathy. As he told one gathering in September 2010, he wanted to “remind our base constituency to stop whining.” If they “didn’t get everything they wanted, it’s time to just buck up here,” not “yield the playing field to those folks who are against everything we stand for.”This was hardly “Yes we can.” In November, Republicans roared back to retake the House, besting their historic 1994 result. Only one month earlier, Biden had delivered to Obama an audit showing that his oversight of the stimulus, while doling out money more slowly and cautiously, had produced almost no waste or fraud, a top priority for the duo that appeared to matter little to actual voters. It was a symbol of the administration’s conservative, misplaced priorities. The Democrats’ brief window of power slammed shut and stayed that way for the rest of Obama’s presidency.Surrender in KentuckyNearly two years in, neither Biden’s bipartisan appeal nor his experience at Senate dealmaking had succeeded in winning over any Republican support for Obama’s deliberately centrist agenda. The belief that it would had always been based on a misunderstanding of history and Biden’s record.The major legislative accomplishments that Biden had racked up in prior decades had succeeded because they had been in the pursuit of Republican goals. Now, when the GOP didn’t want to play ball — when they even blocked conservative restraints on spending that they had historically favored just to deny their opposition any kind of win — Biden’s inside-game strategy could only work when the Republicans thought they could advance their agenda.Democratic insiders like Podesta maintained that to “get anything done in a partisan divide, and a divided Senate,” Biden would be a “tremendous asset because he knows the players, the institution, and he has credibility.” In reality, he was the ideal foil for a ruthless negotiator like McConnell, who quickly realized that Biden was the administration’s soft underbelly. In December 2010, a government shutdown loomed, while both the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and unemployment insurance looked set to expire. With McConnell happy to hold hostage the nearly fifteen million jobless Americans about to lose their government lifeline, Biden personally called him to make a deal.That deal ended up so lopsided that it outraged Democrats across the political spectrum. In exchange for keeping unemployment insurance alive for another thirteen months, extending an education tax credit for two more years, and an eleventh-hour stimulus of payroll tax cuts, Biden gave McConnell not just two more years of high-income tax cuts, but a lower estate tax with a higher exemption, new tax write-offs for businesses, and a maximum 15 percent capital gains tax rate locked in for two years. At one point, Biden’s team had even considered dropping the poorest Americans from the Obama stimulus payments of $400 a year, reversing course at the objections of a Treasury economist who called the idea “immoral.”House Democrats were furious at both the estate tax provision and the Bush tax cut extension, partly because, according to journalist Bob Woodward, Biden hadn’t mentioned the extension was on the table when he briefed Democratic leaders during the talks. Disappointment extended to even the party’s more conservative members, with Dianne Feinstein telling Biden she was “staggered by the enormity of this package.” Three senators interrupted Biden as he tried to present the Obama-backed deal at a private luncheon — among them Bernie Sanders, who had ascended to the upper chamber in 2007. Asserting that “the American people are prepared for a fight,” Sanders vowed to “do everything I can to defeat this proposal,” launching an eight-hour filibuster in which he railed against the concentration of wealth and economic inequality that had crystallized over the last three decades and ramped up under Bush. But enough Democrats eventually capitulated, with some grumbling, for the deal to pass. Three months later, Biden was flattering McConnell in Kentucky, telling an audience that the political elite fundamentally agreed on the issues and that “the process worked.”With Democrats losing the House and eventually the Senate, this was only the beginning. From there on, every time the debt limit or prospect of government shutdown forced another political hostage crisis, McConnell would make a beeline for Biden, hoping to avoid negotiations with then–Majority Leader Harry Reid, his Senate counterpart. Biden had the full backing of Obama, who by that point, under pressure from the GOP and hoping to still record some Beltway accomplishments, had pivoted to doing what Republicans and Biden had been proposing for decades: making a bipartisan “grand bargain” to tackle deficits, including cuts to Social Security and Medicare, something Obama had pledged before he was even inaugurated to “spend some political capital on.”In 2011, with the looming debt ceiling this time the bargaining chip for a GOP militantly opposed to any tax hikes, Biden once more sat at the negotiating table. As his “opening bid,” Biden offered cutting $4 trillion in spending over ten years, with a three-to-one proportion of cuts to new revenue, before later proposing $2 trillion in cuts to general spending, federal retirement funds, Medicare and Medicaid, and, at the GOP’s urging, food stamps. To put this in perspective, the post-9/11 wars that Biden had backed would total $6.4 trillion by 2020. At one point, to the confusion and horror of a fellow Democratic negotiator, Maryland representative Chris Van Hollen, he suddenly called for $200 billion more in cuts that had never even been discussed.Later still, Biden dangled the possibility of Medicare cuts in return for new taxes, before suggesting Democrats might be comfortable raising the eligibility age for entitlements, imposing means testing, and changing the consumer price index calculation — all of which, in practice, either undermined or acted as a stealth cut to Social Security, perhaps the New Deal’s towering achievement. Echoing Republican talking points, he called the Medicare provider tax a “scam.” When Biden’s team reminded him that doing away with it would force states to cut services to the poor, he replied that “we’re going to do lots of hard things” and so “we might as well do this.” As negotiations went on, Biden offered more and more extreme entitlement cuts before exasperatedly admitting he had caved on everything. “All the major things we’re interested in we’ve given up. So basically you’ve pushed us to the limit,” he told McConnell.Just as Clinton’s tryst with Lewinsky killed a cross-party deal to “reform” Social Security in the 1990s, working Americans were only saved thanks to the intransigence of a GOP that refused to give any ground. But Biden would get several more chances.In late 2012, with Obama reelected and the Bush tax cuts expiring, the Democrats held the leverage. Reid was now ready to go over the cliff, let all the tax cuts expire, and bargain with Republicans over allowing them to remain in place just for the middle class and poor. McConnell, knowing the GOP would get the blame, indicated he was ready to accept the deal. But he had one last trump card: the vice president, who he phoned directly on Air Force Two to inform him that Reid was being unreasonable. Yet again, Biden gave McConnell everything he wanted; yet again, Democrats reacted in fury. Biden called members of Congress individually, offering a trademark long-winded monologue imploring them to trust him, a pitch he himself summarized as “This is Joe Biden and I’m your buddy.”With Obama backing the deal, the federal government lost trillions of dollars in revenue from the reinstituted Bush tax cuts. It would get around $600 billion in all, $200 billion less than the Republican House speaker had initially promised, and ultimately even less once Republicans passed a tax cut under Trump in 2017. Biden hadn’t even extracted the authority to raise the debt ceiling from McConnell, leaving the door open for more Republican blackmail. Meanwhile, the super-rich pocketed the windfall, further widening wealth inequality and, more alarmingly, growing their power to push a political system now totally overrun by money further right. Even centrist Democrats shook their heads at the White House’s inability to win while holding all the cards, openly grumbling about its failure. Reid told the White House not to let Biden negotiate with McConnell anymore.But Biden would assist the White House in one last betrayal. In December 2014, with Republicans now controlling both houses of Congress and a potential second government shutdown in sight, Obama, Biden, and the GOP banded together to go around the Democratic leadership and whip votes for a $1.1 trillion spending bill packed with Republican goodies: further erosion of campaign finance restrictions, cuts to a nutrition program for low-income mothers and children, more than $400 billion worth of jet fighters the Pentagon didn’t even want, and, perhaps most notorious, a provision written by — who else? — Citigroup lobbyists that weakened Obama’s own 2010 financial reform.With Biden and Obama lobbying, fifty-seven Democrats in the House and thirty-one in the Senate voted to pass the bill. Elizabeth Warren, by now a senator herself and only one month removed from having been elevated to a leadership position in the party tasking her with outreach to progressive activists, denounced this as a “giveaway to the most powerful banks in the country.”Setting the World AblazeIt was on foreign policy, however, that Biden received the freest rein to operate. Obama appeared to genuinely trust Biden on the subject, regularly seeking his advice during the Democratic primaries and offering him the position of secretary of state when he initially declined the vice presidency. Obama instead gave that post to Clinton after Biden himself recommended her, viewing her foreign policy outlook as similar to his own. Obama had put his administration’s foreign policy in the hands of two people whom he had rightly accused in an early primary debate of helping to “engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation.”Biden, who arguably more than any Democrat had created the crisis in Iraq, was inexplicably tasked by Obama with solving it. At first, that meant intervening on behalf of Western businesses, urging Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki not to charge international oil companies exorbitant prices for the right to tap the country’s oil reserves when contracts came up for auction again.When the 2010 Iraqi elections left both Maliki, who was alienating Iraqis with his increasingly sectarian and authoritarian rule, and his leading opponent, one with a nonsectarian base, without a parliamentary majority, Biden was at a crossroads. Hoping to get a stable Iraqi government in place before the 2010 midterms as well as to ensure US troops’ continued presence in the country past 2010, Biden was persuaded that Maliki was the one to do the job, despite pleas from regional experts and top US officials alike not to back what increasingly looked like a strongman.After staying in power with US support, Maliki returned the favor by refusing to authorize the continued US presence in Iraq, forcing Obama in 2011 to finally meet his campaign promise of leaving Iraq, which he and Biden spun for the media as a voluntary withdrawal. Now firmly ensconced in power, Maliki created a Shia-dominated sectarian government that allied with Shia militias and persecuted Iraq’s Sunni minority, creating an opening for ISIS, a terrorist group formed from the remnants of al-Qaeda and former Baathists, with horrific consequences.In an unexpected twist, Biden ended up being one of the less aggressive members of Obama’s cabinet. He opposed a 40,000-strong troop surge in Afghanistan, the arming of rebels once civil war broke out in Syria, and, perhaps most crucially, the NATO-led war in Libya. Pushed primarily by Clinton, that conflict would end up a foreign policy disaster almost on the scale of Iraq, creating an anarchic power vacuum that allowed extremists to proliferate, open-air slave markets to thrive, and instability to spread well beyond its borders.But Biden did have one major influence. His alternative to the surge in Afghanistan, what he termed “counterterrorism plus,” ultimately became the Obama administration’s overall approach to the “war on terror.” Rather than sending in American forces and engaging in nation-building — a costly and unpopular strategy, particularly once more and more young Americans were inevitably sent home in flag-draped coffins — the US would instead step up “surgical” tactics, like sending in Special Forces and bombing countries via drones.Using this strategy, the “war on terror” that Bush had launched to liberal derision had dramatically expanded by the end of Obama’s two terms, with the US military bombing seven different Muslim-majority countries, stretching from the Middle East to North Africa, with no declaration of war. Far from “surgical,” drone strikes would kill hundreds of these countries’ civilians over the course of eight years — farmers, funerals, a wedding party, and even a sixteen-year-old American citizen who happened to be the son of an accused terrorist. Having improved the United States’ standing in the Arab world simply by winning office, Obama saw it plunge back into the doldrums, with “counterterrorism plus” fueling the same anti-American anger that had led to attacks like September 11 in the first place.Closer to home, the Obama administration grappled with a migrant crisis whose roots lay in US foreign policy. There remained the ongoing question of what to do with the nation’s sizeable population of undocumented immigrants, whose numbers grew with the steady stream of arrivals at the southern border. This escalated during Obama’s second term, when large numbers of people, the majority from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, fled violence and desperation in their home countries, journeyed through Mexico, and reached the US border, many of them applying for asylum. In both cases, the administration took a harsh, unforgiving approach.The crisis had been partly caused by Biden and would now be fueled by him again. He had been “one of the architects” of the Clinton-era Plan Colombia, which he had viewed at the time as a way  to internationalize the “war on drugs.” In practice, the scheme did more to open up the country to foreign investment than to stem the flow of drugs, while the increased investment in security forces that came attached to US funding fueled breathtaking state violence in the country: 1.8 million people displaced in three years and 3,000 innocent people killed.Obama thought this a sufficiently impressive record to charge Biden with spearheading his response to the migrant crisis: the Alliance for Prosperity, a plan that promised financial incentives to Central American states in return for stepping up deportations and border militarization. Those incentives advanced privatization, free trade zones with special regulatory carve-outs for foreign investors, and the creation of logistics corridors for the movement of goods and new infrastructure, such as a new gas pipeline that opened up markets for US exporters. Ironically, these policies were set to perpetuate the very economic and environmental conditions that led migrants to flee the region, and peasants, indigenous people, and environmental activists to protest and, sometimes, die over.While the vast majority of the investment would come from home countries, the United States was on the hook for $1 billion per year over five years. Though the amount of aid fell far short of this, the program became known as “Biden’s billion,” with the vice president making a public push for the scheme to hand $100 million more to abusive security forces that Congress members were, at that very time, trying to bar from military aid programs because of their records of human rights violations.After driving a surge of migrants from their home countries with policies like these, the administration then brutalized them upon their arrival at the US border, largely thanks to powers that Biden and the rest of the Democrats had voted to create in the 1990s. In an atmosphere of anti-immigrant fervor that took hold of the country that decade — and driven in large part by the overcrowded prisons that Biden’s 1980s drug and crime bills had created — Republicans and Democrats, including Biden and many of the party’s other leading lights, joined hands to give the government an array of powers to deal harshly with both documented and undocumented immigrants. Biden’s 1994 crime bill as well as his votes for the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, welfare reform, the Patriot Act, and, most significantly, the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, enshrined into law powers that immigrant rights advocates and civil libertarians denounced: mandatory and indefinite detention of immigrants convicted of even minor drug crimes, fast-track deportations and restrictions on government help for immigrants, and broader definitions of the kinds of crimes even legal residents could be deported for.It was this deportation machine that fell into Obama’s hands upon becoming president, and he used it — to the disappointment and outrage of his Latino supporters — to deport unprecedented numbers of immigrants, breaking apart families and detaining even children in cages and other deplorable conditions. Biden would be on the front lines, boasting in 2014 of “enhancing the enforcement and removal proceedings” of migrants as large numbers of children and others fleeing violence in Central America looked for sanctuary in the United States.Careful not to appear “soft” on immigration as the GOP increasingly used the issue to rile up its base and attack Obama, Biden warned those making the trip from Central America to “be aware of what awaits them.” “It will not be open arms,” he said. Indeed, according to a 2014 lawsuit filed by the ACLU, migrant children were deprived of medical treatment, shackled, sexually abused, and forced to drink toilet water by border agents. Within three years, this architecture would fall into the hands of a very different president.The 2016 ElectionWhat ultimately transpired in November 2016, as Obama prepared to calmly hand the presidency to his designated successor, took almost everyone by surprise: world leaders, pundits, even voters themselves. But it probably shouldn’t have.Biden and the brand of liberal politics that he and much of the Democratic Party had pursued for decades created the ideal set of circumstances for a right-wing populist to come to power. The neoliberal consensus he had championed, with Bill Clinton perhaps its ideal and Obama its last viable proponent, could only hold so long. This was not a trend unique to the United States; countries with similarly triangulating liberal parties saw voters dramatically reject their respective political establishments around the same time, with Britain’s 2016 Brexit vote just one example.Biden had been thinking about a third tilt at the presidency since at least as far back as 2011, when a top Obama aide was forced to dress him down for holding strategy meetings about an impending run. Running for president was, after all, what vice presidents did.But Biden demurred. Obama and virtually the entire party establishment were behind Clinton, the candidate who was “supposed” to have won in 2008. Those primaries were a wide-open race, with a gaggle of Democrats, both known and obscure, going for gold. The 2016 field had only five candidates, and even these would be whittled down to two soon enough. In the end, Bernie Sanders — the supposedly unelectable Vermont socialist who had spun his political transformation of the state’s biggest city into the longest run an independent officeholder had ever had at the national level — dared to carry through a challenge against the political order represented by Biden and Clinton.There was another factor in Biden’s decision. Personal tragedy had reared its head in Biden’s life once more with the 2015 death of his son Beau, who had survived his mother’s fatal car crash, deployment to Iraq, and a 2010 stroke, rising to become Delaware’s attorney general and eyeing a run for governor before succumbing to brain cancer. Though CNN would leave an empty podium on the stage of the first Democratic debate just in case Biden decided to join the race, the loss was too much. Biden sat out the race. With Clinton guaranteed to win the primary and possibly the general election, any hope of living out his boyhood dream of becoming president vanished.Or did it? The course of the Democratic primary should have been a tip-off that something was in the air. Clinton — like Biden, a 1990s-era neoliberal Democrat who had embraced every centrist shibboleth and ran yet another cautious, conventional campaign stressing incremental progress — soon found herself battling hard to survive the primaries. Sanders, meanwhile, surged seemingly out of nowhere by doing everything Biden had been telling Democrats for decadesnotto do: he talked about poverty; rejected big-money fundraising; stressed diplomacy over war; rejected free trade and the free market in favor of bold government intervention; took forthright positions on divisive social issues; and called for a political form of class warfare against the rich for the benefit of the working class. Baffling and frustrating political observers with its success, Sanders’s run, once dispatched, could be written off by a spooked establishment as just another Howard Deanesque fad candidacy that the unruly Democratic base indulged in from time to time.But then came Donald Trump. A garish, scandal-ridden career criminal and former game show host, Trump even more than Sanders seemed the epitome of every possible rule for whatnotto do to win an election. Though pandering to the bigotry and intolerance that had long been a thinly veiled undercurrent running through the GOP, Trump also rhetorically rejected what had been Republican politics as usual for decades, criticizing Republican (and Democratic) wars, opposing free trade, attacking the wealthy elite he himself was a part of, pledging to protect entitlements, and calling for state intervention in the economy to help ordinary working Americans.But that was the GOP, after all. Those people arecrazy. Trump may have won the Republican nomination with a shambolic, offensive campaign that seemed perpetually teetering on the brink of collapse, but there was no way he would win the general election. Whether Republican or Democrat, a nominee courted the party base in the primary, then moderated their views in the general;everyoneknew that. While Clinton did everything a candidate was supposed to do — she took the right centrist positions, appealed to bipartisanship and pragmatism, racked up important endorsements, promised a muscular foreign policy, and so on — Trump did everything you weren’t, keeping his heterodox, sometimes grossly offensive political positions while continuing to behave erratically. He launched blatantly hypocritical attacks on Clinton’s tough-on-crime past, her husband’s sexual crimes, her elite connections and corruption, and much else. Who on Earth would vote this man in?It turned out that virtually everyone had overestimated how motivated Democratic voters would be to turn out against Trump. While Obama had defied a struggling economy and his own pursuit of austerity to win reelection in 2012 largely on the back of his popularity among young and minority voters, Obama couldn’t hand this coalition to Clinton. With two historically unpopular candidates, an uneven economic recovery that bypassed large swaths of the country, and Clinton determined to run yet another unambitious centrist Democratic campaign that by the end focused overwhelmingly on Trump’s personality, his lack of fitness for office, and his ultimately nonexistent ties to the Kremlin, voters again stayed home. After climbing steadily for twenty years, black voter turnout sharply dropped from its record high of 66.6 percent in 2012.“I don’t feel bad,” one African American barber from Milwaukee told aNew York Timesreporter after the result came in. “Both of them were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway.”\n",

There were few people better qualified to talk on the subject: Biden had spent virtually his entire adult life in the body and was one of the most outspoken proponents of its culture of chummy dealmaking.', 'There were few people better qualified to talk on the subject: Biden had spent virtually his entire adult life in the body and was one of the most outspoken proponents of its culture of chummy dealmaking.', 'Topics ranged from its foundations and evolution to the influence of antebellum political giant Henry Clay, “The Great Compromiser” who had staved off civil war through a series of famed bargains that also had the effect of extending the life of slavery.Biden was on enemy territory. He was speaking at the behest of the University of Louisville’s McConnell Center, which, like the Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium on whose third floor he prepared to deliver his remarks, drew its name from the source of its corporate funding: Mitch McConnell, Kentucky’s longest-serving senator, who had ascended to the Senate Republican leadership over a twenty-six-year-long career founded on his unparalleled ability to raise money from powerful interests.', 'McConnell, who would be speaking alongside Biden, was also the chief architect of the “shellacking” Biden’s party and administration had just received.Only two years earlier, with another charismatic figure as their nominee and popular rage against the Bush administration further inflamed by the worst financial crash since the 1930s, the Democrats had swept to a level of domination in Washington not seen for thirty years, fueling talk of the GOP as a “permanent minority” party.', 'Behind closed doors, Republican leaders plotted to reverse each Democratic gain by 2012 through an aggressive united front of opposition to each and every move the new administration made.Admitting that his single-biggest priority was making Biden’s boss a “one-term president,” McConnell spent the next two years leading a historic campaign of obstruction in the Senate against the Obama agenda.', 'The coup de grâce was a December 2010 deal McConnell had personally struck with Biden to howls of outrage from Democrats, trading thirteen more months of unemployment insurance at a time of nearly double-digit joblessness for a host of more permanent giveaways to the wealthy.Biden’s fifty-minute speech the following February painted things differently, however.', 'As McConnell looked on, Biden warmly paid tribute to the man who had devoted the last two years to smothering his administration’s agenda.', 'He pointed to their deal as “the only truly bipartisan event that occurred in the first two years of our administration,” proof that “the process worked.” And he reminded the audience about the essential unity of those who ran the government: whether they were liberal or conservative, Tea Party or Blue Dog, “they all ran for office because they love their country.”“We basically all agree on the nature of the problems we face,” he concluded.Biden’s comments were dubious by the standards of anyone who had lived through the preceding two years.', 'While Republicans responded to their electoral collapse two years earlier with a ruthless determination to defeat their opponents, take back power, and halt the leftward swing in political momentum that was expected to follow the election, Democrats seemed wedded to a hokey faith in the political values of a bygone era with a different Republican Party. It wasn’t that they were playing two entirely different ball games; Biden and Democrats like him didn’t even seem to know a game was being played.Biden’s continued faith in principles that his adversaries had long abandoned and his willingness to give it all away at the negotiating table made him the go-to contact for every one of McConnell’s future fiscal hostage scenarios. The inability of Biden and the administration to effectively push back would mean disaster, first in working Americans’ pocketbooks and then at the ballot box.The Throwback CandidateDespite giving himself an early start two-and-a-half years before the first primary, Biden knew winning in 2008 would be tough.', 'The inability of Biden and the administration to effectively push back would mean disaster, first in working Americans’ pocketbooks and then at the ballot box.The Throwback CandidateDespite giving himself an early start two-and-a-half years before the first primary, Biden knew winning in 2008 would be tough. He would almost certainly be running against Sen.', 'Once upon a time, Biden’s “nuanced” position on abortion rights — drawn at least partly from his Catholic upbringing — had marked him as a frustrating but fascinating renegade among Democrats.', 'Telling a reporter in 1974 that he disliked theRoe v. Wadedecision because “I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body,” he eventually settled on what he called “the only consistent position intellectually, which is that if you say government should be out, then government should be out.”With this as his guiding light, Biden cast a decade’s worth of votes that turned into political boomerangs. Though opposing a 1974 constitutional amendment banning abortions — he didn’t have the right to force his beliefs on others, he explained — he backed measures barring federal money from being used “directly or indirectly to pay for or encourage” abortions, prohibiting poor women from using Medicaid to pay for the procedure, and forbidding federal workers from using their government health benefits to obtain one, something he voted for five times before it finally became law.Some measures had long-lasting legacies.', 'Biden’s support for the 1976 Hyde Amendment secured a landmark anti-abortion triumph by barring federal funding of abortions, becoming so entrenched in subsequent years that abortion rights campaigners simply gave up on repealing it.', 'Meanwhile, the Reagan-era “Mexico City policy” that Biden supported, also known as the “global gag rule” for its stringent blackballing of NGOs that so much ascounseledwomen on abortions, would be in place for nineteen of the next thirty-four years, rescinded by Democratic presidents and reinstated and toughened by Republican ones in a perpetual loop.Though striving for a middle-of-the-road position, Biden backed some extreme measures. He helped defeat a 1977 amendment to remove all restrictions on federal funding of abortions and voted instead for what thePhiladelphia Inquirercalled “the toughest ever anti-abortion measure,” one that extended that ban to even cases of incest and rape.', 'Wadeby letting either states or Congress decide the question of abortion — whichever was “more restrictive.”Unlike his appeasement of anti-busing groups, Biden weathered intense pressure from reproductive rights campaigners for taking such positions.', 'By the late 1980s, Biden had succeeded in angering everyone: both anti-abortion groups that vowed to defeat someone they saw as a turncoat and pro-choice groups like Planned Parenthood that complained he “usually votes against us,” with both sides accusing him of playing politics.These relationships were only further strained by Biden’s role in the battle over Reagan and Bush Sr’s Supreme Court nominees.', 'Deemed an “anti-choice” lawmaker in 1987 by the liberal feminists of the National Women’s Political Caucus, Biden became a lightning rod for abortion-related blame, with abortion opponents complaining he wastooharsh to the Republican nominees and supporters more accurately grousing that he wasn’t toughenough.', 'Biden’s failure to successfully challenge the nominees — particularly egregious in the case of Clarence Thomas and all the more so in the case of Anthony Kennedy — meant both justices would form part of the slim right-wing majorities delivering key anti-abortion rulings in the decades ahead.', 'Biden’s failure to successfully challenge the nominees — particularly egregious in the case of Clarence Thomas and all the more so in the case of Anthony Kennedy — meant both justices would form part of the slim right-wing majorities delivering key anti-abortion rulings in the decades ahead. In the case of Kennedy, the opinion he coauthored in a 1992 case then celebrated for upholdingRoeactually weakened it, opening the floodgates to an assortment of crafty state laws that didn’t explicitly outlaw abortion but made it all but impossible.Thus by the 2000s, Biden seemed an awkward fit in a Democratic Party that had become markedly more liberal on social issues, even as it clung to the economically conservative philosophy it embraced under Reagan. Though Biden too had become more liberal on the issue, whatever political benefit he might have gained from this was undone in 2003, when, after voting repeatedly over the preceding eight years for a ban on so-called “partial-birth” abortions, he cast a vote that helped make the measure law under Bush Jr.', 'In the case of Kennedy, the opinion he coauthored in a 1992 case then celebrated for upholdingRoeactually weakened it, opening the floodgates to an assortment of crafty state laws that didn’t explicitly outlaw abortion but made it all but impossible.Thus by the 2000s, Biden seemed an awkward fit in a Democratic Party that had become markedly more liberal on social issues, even as it clung to the economically conservative philosophy it embraced under Reagan.

His affordable education plan covered half the tuition of a public four-year college and did so through every government-allergic neoliberal’s favorite bureaucratic instrument: tax credits.', 'Meanwhile, Biden returned to the tough-on-crime well, proposing a law-enforcement hiring spree meant to build on his 1994 legislation — even though violent crime had nearly halved since 1990.If his ideas fell short of the challenges at hand, it’s because Biden believed the biggest issue on voters’ minds was “security for their families, physical security,” and the ongoing Iraq War.', 'But Biden’s attempt to cast himself as the safest pair of hands on foreign policy was plagued by the same vulnerability that hampered almost all of his rivals: his vote for said war.It was this more than anything — more so even than his charisma and electrifying speeches — that provided a wide-open lane for a young, first-term African American senator from Illinois named Barack Obama to ascend past Biden and the rest of the field and quickly establish himself as a front-runner.', 'While Biden had led the march to war, Obama was on the record opposing it in a 2002 speech. By April 2007, in a poll asking the members of the progressive grassroots group MoveOn.org which candidate would best lead the country out of Iraq, Biden ended up second to last, with Obama, advocating a much speedier withdrawal, coming in first.Not helping were Biden’s frequent “gaffes.” Whether it was saying that “you cannot go into a Dunkin’ Donuts or 7-Eleven unless you have a slight Indian accent,” describing Obama as “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean,” or repeatedly invoking Delaware’s history as a “slave state” to make the case for his appeal to Southern voters — Delaware had only fought for the Union “because we couldn’t figure out how to get to the South,” he told one mostly Republican audience — it seemed like Biden couldn’t say anything without drawing a hail of justified criticism.', 'By April 2007, in a poll asking the members of the progressive grassroots group MoveOn.org which candidate would best lead the country out of Iraq, Biden ended up second to last, with Obama, advocating a much speedier withdrawal, coming in first.Not helping were Biden’s frequent “gaffes.” Whether it was saying that “you cannot go into a Dunkin’ Donuts or 7-Eleven unless you have a slight Indian accent,” describing Obama as “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean,” or repeatedly invoking Delaware’s history as a “slave state” to make the case for his appeal to Southern voters — Delaware had only fought for the Union “because we couldn’t figure out how to get to the South,” he told one mostly Republican audience — it seemed like Biden couldn’t say anything without drawing a hail of justified criticism. What had passed for straight-shooting and candor in an America and a Democratic Party twenty years younger and far less diverse now came off as offensive, out of touch, and old-fashioned.With his number-one selling point neutralized, a lack of ambitious proposals dealing with Americans’ pressing material concerns, and no 1987-style youth appeal to paper over his deficiencies, Biden fell far behind Obama, Clinton, and several others in both fundraising and polling, even running second in his own state.', 'What had passed for straight-shooting and candor in an America and a Democratic Party twenty years younger and far less diverse now came off as offensive, out of touch, and old-fashioned.With his number-one selling point neutralized, a lack of ambitious proposals dealing with Americans’ pressing material concerns, and no 1987-style youth appeal to paper over his deficiencies, Biden fell far behind Obama, Clinton, and several others in both fundraising and polling, even running second in his own state.

This same coalition, coupled with disgruntled voters fed up with eight years of GOP rule, strengthened the Democrats’ control of Congress.As president, much of Obama’s job involved cleaning up messes that Biden had helped create. Most pressing was the 2008 financial crash.', 'Byron Dorgan had predicted a decade before, the repeal of Glass-Steagall, which Biden and virtually every other Democrat had voted for in 1999, while not the main cause of another Wall Street crash — that had been the product of predatory lending by the mortgage industry — nevertheless made the resulting crisis much more severe. Between 2007 and 2011, a quarter of American families lost at least 75 percent of their wealth; black families were hit particularly hard.Besides this, the list of tasks facing the administration was daunting.', 'He and his party controlled not just the presidency but both houses of Congress; within six months, they would have a filibuster-proof supermajority, albeit a flimsy one, in the Senate.

It was Obama’s presidency, and it was he who demobilized his volunteer army, who failed to prosecute Wall Street and capitalize on public anger at its greed, who went back on his pledge to end the wars and took Bush’s “war on terror” to new extremes, who declined to apply pressure to Democrats holding up his agenda, and who shied away from taking more radical steps to deal with an epochal crisis for fear of being labeled a “socialist,” something he had already been called incessantly long before winning an election.But despite an initially rocky start to their relationship, Biden’s status as “counselor in chief” meant he was deeply involved at the administration’s core.', 'And as details about the greed and criminality of those who had wrecked the world economy trickled out, a bipartisan anger burned across the country.So what happened?Though Biden would have no compunction in later claiming Obama’s achievements as his own, he didn’t deserve the blame for every one of the administration’s failures any more than he did its successes.

During one transition meeting, Biden piped up to tell this lopsided team that bailing out one side over another would be a mistake and that economic policy mustn’t pit Wall Street against “Main Street” — as if both of those hadn’t already happened, in Wall Street’s favor.When the administration did throw a lifeline to “Main Street,” it defined that term rather uniquely. Obama sought to placate his conservative critics by redirecting some of the 2008 bailout money not to underwater homeowners or debt-ridden workers but into loans for small businesses, which had already been lavished with tax breaks.', '“It’s high time we help Main Street,” Biden said about the measure, arguing that because small businesses were “the engine of employment,” funding them was the Main Street equivalent of the bank bailouts.At $30 billion, this supposed Main Street bailout was nowhere near the scale of the one that banks had gotten. Worse, a public struggling under the load of several different burdens — and already enraged and confused thattheywere paying to save the story’s villains, who then used that money to shower their executives with big salaries and bonuses before bouncing back to record profits within a few years — watched as their money once more went to help anyone but them.', 'Adding insult to injury, after two years, only $4 billion of that “Main Street” lifeline had been spent, and 80 percent of that was used by the community banks who received it to pay off whatever bailout money they still owed the government.Meanwhile, on what would become Obama’s signature accomplishment — health care reform — Biden served as conservatizing force.', 'Obama had already cut a backroom deal trading away the public option for support from the hospital industry, opting instead for a Republican-inspired health care plan he hoped would get bipartisan support. Though Biden loyally whipped Democratic votes for the bill and unsuccessfully wooed Republican “moderates” who signaled they might support such a version, Biden had urged Obama to abandon ship once it stalled in August 2009. Biden feared that, like Clinton’s doomed health care reform effort that he had been similarly unenthusiastic about, its failure would hobble the administration.Once signed into law —“a big fucking deal,” as Biden memorably told Obama on a hot mic — Biden had another objection: rules issued by the Health and Human Services secretary in 2011 mandating that even church-affiliated institutions like hospitals provide free contraception for women, which angered Catholic groups.', 'Though Biden loyally whipped Democratic votes for the bill and unsuccessfully wooed Republican “moderates” who signaled they might support such a version, Biden had urged Obama to abandon ship once it stalled in August 2009.

The stimulus had come in for a lot of criticism already in part because Biden needlessly assured the press that “some of this money is going to be wasted” and “some people are being scammed already.” To show what would happen to recipients of stimulus funds who failed to file the necessary reports, Biden’s team chose to make an example of a nonprofit that provided food to hungry children, denying it any further funds as punishment.Biden’s work was such a success that it earned him the nickname “Sheriff” from Obama — and his appointment to its sequel: the Campaign to Cut Waste, launched two years later to “hunt down misspent tax dollars in every agency and department of this government,” in Obama’s words.', 'The stimulus had come in for a lot of criticism already in part because Biden needlessly assured the press that “some of this money is going to be wasted” and “some people are being scammed already.” To show what would happen to recipients of stimulus funds who failed to file the necessary reports, Biden’s team chose to make an example of a nonprofit that provided food to hungry children, denying it any further funds as punishment.Biden’s work was such a success that it earned him the nickname “Sheriff” from Obama — and his appointment to its sequel: the Campaign to Cut Waste, launched two years later to “hunt down misspent tax dollars in every agency and department of this government,” in Obama’s words.

Upon taking office, Obama dispatched Biden to assure nervous labor audiences that the bill, opposed by business groups to the tune of millions of dollars, would pass in the first year. “If a union is what you want, then a union is what you should get,” Biden told labor leaders.Had card check passed, it could have given flagging union membership a shot in the arm, with reverberating impacts beyond that: besides securing higher wages and better benefits for their members, strong unions had been historically key to progressive triumphs like the Civil Rights Movement.', '“If a union is what you want, then a union is what you should get,” Biden told labor leaders.Had card check passed, it could have given flagging union membership a shot in the arm, with reverberating impacts beyond that: besides securing higher wages and better benefits for their members, strong unions had been historically key to progressive triumphs like the Civil Rights Movement.', 'And in theory, Biden was exactly the person to make it happen.', 'And in theory, Biden was exactly the person to make it happen.

The neoliberal consensus he had championed, with Bill Clinton perhaps its ideal and Obama its last viable proponent, could only hold so long.', 'This was not a trend unique to the United States; countries with similarly triangulating liberal parties saw voters dramatically reject their respective political establishments around the same time, with Britain’s 2016 Brexit vote just one example.Biden had been thinking about a third tilt at the presidency since at least as far back as 2011, when a top Obama aide was forced to dress him down for holding strategy meetings about an impending run. Running for president was, after all, what vice presidents did.But Biden demurred.', 'Running for president was, after all, what vice presidents did.But Biden demurred. Obama and virtually the entire party establishment were behind Clinton, the candidate who was “supposed” to have won in 2008.', 'In the end, Bernie Sanders — the supposedly unelectable Vermont socialist who had spun his political transformation of the state’s biggest city into the longest run an independent officeholder had ever had at the national level — dared to carry through a challenge against the political order represented by Biden and Clinton.There was another factor in Biden’s decision. Personal tragedy had reared its head in Biden’s life once more with the 2015 death of his son Beau, who had survived his mother’s fatal car crash, deployment to Iraq, and a 2010 stroke, rising to become Delaware’s attorney general and eyeing a run for governor before succumbing to brain cancer.', 'Personal tragedy had reared its head in Biden’s life once more with the 2015 death of his son Beau, who had survived his mother’s fatal car crash, deployment to Iraq, and a 2010 stroke, rising to become Delaware’s attorney general and eyeing a run for governor before succumbing to brain cancer.', 'Personal tragedy had reared its head in Biden’s life once more with the 2015 death of his son Beau, who had survived his mother’s fatal car crash, deployment to Iraq, and a 2010 stroke, rising to become Delaware’s attorney general and eyeing a run for governor before succumbing to brain cancer.

            "article content: Earlier this month, the most conservative of the major candidates in the Democratic field all but secured the party’s presidential nomination. However one accounts for Joe Biden’s victory, it should not be controversial to say that it was not a win for the left or for progressive Democrats.Biden neither campaigned on the left nor meaningfully sought the support of progressive groups, making a public habit oftelling activistswho even politely disagreed with him to take a hike and go vote for someone else. Thanks to the entire party establishment rallying around him, he won anyway, largely on his own terms and from within his own comfort zone: pitching himself as the safe, pragmatic choice who could be counted upon by an anxious electorate (and a nervous class of big donors and business interests) not to rock the boat or have rough ideological edges of any kind. “I need you very badly,” Biden tolda hundred wealthy contributorsat the Carlyle Hotel in New York’s Upper East Side last summer “[If I’m elected president] No one’s standard of living will change, nothing fundamentally would change.”He could scarcely have put it any clearer than that.Nonetheless, the weeks since Biden’s de facto nomination have given rise to a curious media phenomenon which has some commentators speculating that the former vice president may yet surprise everyone and become a progressive standard-bearer after all — perhaps even a transformative figure whose presidency remakes both the party and the country he leads.On what exactly is this contention being based?Much of the argument hinges on the platform Biden has formally adopted which, among other things, commits him tostrengthening unions,new spendingon green infrastructure and education, and a public option for health insurance. Biden alsorecently endorsedElizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan and said henow supportsa partial forgiveness of student debt.For writers likeNY Mag’s Jonathan Chait and theNYTs’ Michelle Goldberg, all this is reason enough to think Biden might be a whole lot more progressive than he seems. As Chaitwould have it, in fact, comrade Joe is actually pitching “one of the largest wealth transfers in American history” on the basis of his tax plan alone. And that’s not all. “There is plenty more liberal meat on the bones of Biden’s program,” he writes, noting a suite of other policies including a $15 minimum wage and $17 trillion in clean energy investment. Goldberg,for her part, thinks Biden’s labor policy is fantastic, citing progressive economist Lawrence Mishel (who says no Democratic nominee in his lifetime has presented “as robust and fleshed out a policy suite on labor standards and unions.”)With a pretty significant caveat (more on that in a moment) the above may actually be true. Biden’s agenda is, on paper, a reform-minded program that in several respects reaches beyond anything a centrist Democratic presidential candidate has gotten behind before. As some would have it, this is symptomatic of an encouraging shift in American liberalism, ever the tip of the spear when it comes to ushering in epochal social, economic, and cultural changes.Which brings us to a second pillar of the Could Biden Actually Be Progressive meme, namely the idea that the former vice president, whatever his past commitments or patterns of behavior, will be carried by a wider zeitgeist that has seen the entire Democratic Party gradually bend towards the arc of progress. “To be sure, Biden speaks lovingly of Republicans and harks back to a time of bipartisanship, but he’s no moderate,”writesBen Koltun for Morning Consult. “The Democratic Party has moved left over the years and so has Biden…So-called moderate Democrats today are leftists in the arc of Democratic history.” Goldberg agrees,writingthat “Biden has always positioned himself at the center of the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party has moved left.” Chait thinks much the same, arguing that while Biden does indeed promise a return to normalcy, this is basically interchangeable progress in an uninterrupted liberal lineage represented by Roosevelt, Johnson, and Obama. Thus, while liberalism in 2020 may be about little more than continuity with the past, restoration of the old somehow implies progress towards the new.QED.This line of reasoning is somewhat in tension with another part of the argument for Biden’s crypto-progressive bona fides, which wonders whether his conservative reputation might actually be evidence that a transformative liberal presidency lies ahead. “Like Pelosi, Biden has credibility with powerful blocs within the Democratic Party,”musesKoltun. “He’s in a better position than either Sanders or Warren in bringing the whole Democratic caucus along.” Similarly neither FDR nor Johnson, asGoldberg observes, were initially seen as progressive standard-bearers but ultimately proved to be two of liberalism’s most accomplished figures. If only Nixon could go to China, or so the logic goes, perhaps only Biden can usher in a second New Deal.Little about the first, and most potentially persuasive, of these points is actually in dispute. Go to Joe Biden’s official website and you’ll indeed find a reform-minded program with plenty of chicken soup for the progressive soul. The problem is assuming Biden will actually meaningfully campaign on any of it. The 2016 Democratic platform was similarlyheraldedas the “most progressive ever” but its nominee produced the mostpolicy-free TV blitzin modern political history. Presidential candidates are not strictly bound to run on the policies found in their own official platforms and there’s little reason to believe Biden is going to pivot leftward in a general election and abandon the more conservatively-oriented narrative he’s championed so far.As none other than Chait himself observes, many of Biden’s stated proposals will face stiff resistance from the wealthy and from moneyed interests — as virtually anything worth pursuing invariably does. The complication, which goes unacknowledged in the resulting argument, is that Biden has openly courted many of these same interests over the course of his campaign: hislist of fundraisers, advisors, and donorsbeing a veritable who’s who of bagmen from the illustrious realms of Big Pharma, banking, real estate, and private equity. Sure, Biden is officially pitching ambitious proposals like a public option for health insurance. But he also launched his campaign at a fundraiserhostedby a health insurance executive and, as of last summer,had receivedthe most money in the Democratic field from insurance and pharmaceutical employees.In the context of a primary electionshaped heavilyby institutional opposition to Medicare For All and the populist candidate crusading for it, Biden’s public option — like many of thewatered down healthcare proposalsproduced by the Democratic field — emerged as a kind of conservative compromise designed to balance the demands of liberal voters and progressive groups with those of profit-driven private industry. With the Sanders insurgency safely neutralized there’s little reason to believe Biden’s next move won’t be a further compromise (i.e. retreat) from the position he currently holds as donors and special interests inevitably rally against that as well. Is a figure like Biden, who has based his entire electoral pitch on securing and maintaining the support of exactly these groups, really going to go to the mats when they resist his agenda? The answer seems pretty obvious.Conservative ReactionInsofar as the Democratic Party as an institution has moved in a more progressive direction (whatever that actually means), Biden’s candidacy can only be read as a conservative reaction to many parts of the shift. On every one of the issues said to matter most to liberals today — racism, immigration, reproductive rights, and the politics of identity — the former vice president is a reactionary throwback who has been on the wrong side of things for the vast majority of a lengthy career that began when the Democratic caucus still included southern Dixiecrats (several of whom, incidentally, were bosom chums). Thus, in the span of only a few weeks, a liberal culture that zealously embraced the #MeToo moment just a few short years ago has had to awkwardly renegotiate its relationship to sexual assault allegations for no other reason than that the figurecurrently being accusedhappens to be named Biden. Come November, leading figures in that same culture will call on the nation to strike a blow against racism by rallying around Strom Thurmond’s eulogist.When the Sanders candidacy was suspended earlier this month, a coalition of major progressive groups, many of them youth-driven, issued alist of demandsfor Biden which included, among other things, that he pledge not to appoint “zero current or former Wall Street executives or corporate lobbyists, or people affiliated with the fossil fuel, health insurance or private prison corporations” to his team or cabinet. He responded in kindby appointingMilton FreidmanadmirerLarry Summers as an advisor, the political equivalent of giving progressive activists a giant middle finger.Suffice it to say, this is not a pattern of behavior that suggests Biden is particularly serious about pursuing any of the progressive measures currently on his official agenda. His entire candidacy, in fact, grates cacophonously against the idea that liberalism today has much to do with progress in either a social or economic sense. Though far from the Democratic establishment’s first choice, Biden emerged victorious principally because he was the measure of last resort against a youthful populist insurgency that threatened big donors and corporate interests and briefly forced even dull as ditchwater centrists to talk like serious reformers. His ascendence represents not only a win for the most conservative figure in the primary, but a repudiation of the only significant effort in modern history to change how the Democratic Party and its leading figures fundamentally operate — all on behalf of big donors and party grandees and without significant overture to the cultural liberalism that supposedly defines the current Democratic zeitgeist.Assuming Biden’s oft-elusive and zombie-like campaign actually survives the pressure of the next few months, we should fully expect it to embrace the conventional Democratic strategy of going mum on all the softly populist elements in its own platform, chasing conservatively-minded suburban voters, and pivoting to the so-called center. And in the likely event that such a maneuver occurs, many of the liberal commentators currently musing that Joe Biden may in fact be the second coming of FDR will probably deem it, yet again, a necessary tactical retreat in the face of the eternal Republican menace.Call this state of affairs whatever you want, but don’t call it progress.\n",

            "article content: Well, it finally happened. After months and weeks of wrangling, sniping, bowing, and scraping, and several missed deadlines, Joe Biden has finally chosen his running mate: former career prosecutor and California senator Kamala Harris.We may well look back on the path it took to get here as a preview of what’s to come should Biden win. This year’s VP-selection process was particularly chaotic, with different, opposing factions — fromBiden insiderstoprogressiveactivists toDemocratic officialstogroupsofmajor donors— jostling for influence and nudging, eventhreatening, Biden to make their preferred choice.Eager contenders would rise to the top, meet privately with Biden, appear on TV with him,fundraisedesperately for his campaign, then suddenly fall out of favor. Sometimes he would cruelly dash their hopeslive on TV; sometimes they would sink under ahail of leaksmeant to undermine them. Through this shambolic process, Biden ultimatelyblew at least threeof his own self-imposed deadlines.This was far from unique to the VP search. Biden has long had a reputation forlacking disciplineandbeing indecisive, something hecarried overto the current campaign,nearly sabotaging himselfbefore he began with a late start that saw him miss out on top hires. Even theTimescan barely find the euphemisms to garnish these flaws,referring tohis “nonlinear decision-making processes” and “habit of extending deadlines in a way that leaves some Democrats anxious and annoyed.”To wit, Biden ran a campaign that can generously be described asleisurely, and his eventual comeback and primary victoryowed almost entirelyto a coalition of centrist media and Democrats working and self-sacrificing to drag him over the line in spite of himself. While we can’t yet know for sure if this process will also characterize Biden’s presidency, we’ve seen how the jockeying among different factional interests in the party has now produced the choice of Harris for his running mate.Harris’s possible ascension to the White House solidifies what Biden’s nomination already represented: the defeat, at least temporarily, of the left of the Democratic Party by the party’s corporate faction, and the determination of its elites to barrel ahead with the shallow, corporate politics of the Obama era, a politics mainly concerned with lowering the expectations of ordinary people.Indeed, one of the reasons it was hard to imagine anyone else but Harris ending up on the ticket is that she so snugly embodies the modern Democratic Party — which also means almost everything you’re about to hear about her has little to do with who she actually is.Far from the “progressive prosecutor” Harris has been masquerading as since angling for a 2020 run, her record bears no resemblance to figures who might actually fit that description, like Larry Krasner or Keith Ellison. Even in a party that embraced Biden- and Clinton-style tough-on-crime policies, Harris stands out for her cruelty: shefoughtto keep innocent people in jail,blockedpayouts to the wrongfully convicted,arguedfor keeping non-violent offenders in jail as a source of cheap labor,withheldevidence that could have freed numerous prisoners,tried to dismissa suit to end solitary confinement in California, anddeniedgender reassignment surgery to trans inmates. A recent reportdetailedhow Harris risked being held in contempt of court for resisting a court order to release non-violent prisoners, which one law professor compared to Southern resistance to 1950s desegregation orders.Harris loves to laugh. Watching Harris cacklinglike a cartoon villainaboutprosecutingparents of truant schoolkids is one of the more bone-chilling things you’re likely to see in politics. Other things Harris found funny? Theideaof building schools rather than prisons, and theconceptof legalizing pot. Five years later shelaughed again, this time while running for president and fondly recallingherpot-smoking days, as she mugged for a younger audience. Extra hilarious was the fact that her office hadconvicted nearly 2,000 peoplefor marijuana offenses while she was San Francisco’s district attorney.Harris’s callousness toward the poor and powerless has been matched only by her sympathy for the rich and powerful. Most notoriously, Harrisoverruledher own office’s recommendation to prosecute the predatory bank of current Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, who later donated to her Senate campaign, then allegedlytried to cover upher inaction.Despite California’s status as the epicenter of foreclosure scams, Harris’s Mortgage Fraud Strike Force prosecutedfewer cases of foreclosure consultant fraudthan many county DAs. Rather than use her office to constrain the growth of tech monopolies, emails recently obtained by theHuffington Postshow shecourted them, receivingsignificant financial backingfrom Silicon Valley in return.It’s recently been declared out of bounds to refer to her ambition, but the fact is that Harris, like Biden, Obama, and, sadly, the majority of politicians, has been driven above all by concern for her own career prospects. Just look attheseclipsof a forty-four-year-old Harris explaining in August 2008 — aspoverty, war, and aballooning housing crisisgripped the country and her state in particular — what would be different about the country after eight years of her presidency: that “we would be willing to embrace the idea that we actually have an incredible talent pool,” that the US would have “a population of people who were informed not only about the great history of our country, but also world history,” and that “we all would decide proudly that we are all, as Americans, patriots,” all of whom would wear flags on their lapels.In other words, she had no idea.So if Harris isn’t actually a progressive with ambitious policy commitments, what exactly does she bring to the ticket? Democrat-aligned media is citing her mixed Indian and Jamaican heritage, which they hope will excite voters of color for November, and her toughness and aggressiveness, which they envision being deployed against Trump and, particularly vice president Mike Pence in their eventual debate.Both of these are hard to square with reality. Contrary to the strange world of liberal consultants and media, people of color don’t mindlessly vote for just anyone who shares their skin color or national background. After she dropped out of the presidential race,punditafterpunditmarveled at how she had failed to win the support of black voters, barely registering in her own home state by the end. She ultimately dropped out before a single primary was held, saving herself the embarrassment of aBiden ’08–styleshowing in Iowa and beyond.As for the second point, Harris’s feeble showing in the polls was matched by a dithering campaign that saw the former prosecutor underwhelm in debates and run away from her own positions. After cosponsoring Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All bill in 2017, she joined Sanders as one of only two candidates who said they favored abolishing private health insurance in a June 2019 debate, before swiftly walking it back the day after,claimingshe misunderstood the question.She then came out with herown health care plan, which expanded private insurers’ role in health care and added an absurd transition period of ten years, or two-and-a-half presidential terms.Much the same happened with Harris’s most memorable debate moment: attacking her current running mate over hisleading rolein the racist anti-busing movement. Harris’s campaign somehow had T-shirts commemorating the moment ready to sellmere hours afterthe debate was over, but she soon helpfully clarified that she herself had in factheld the same position on busingas the one she had just attacked Biden over. After that, Harris was left speechless by Tulsi Gabbard’s debate-stagecriticism of her prosecutorial record, and her attempt to challenge Elizabeth Warren to call for Twitter to ban the presidentfell embarrassingly flat.No, Harris’s real value to Biden is threefold. One is her popularity among the donor class, having raked in massive amounts of cash during her campaign from not just big tech, butWall Street,health insurers and pharmaceuticals, andvarious billionaires, among others. Soon after Biden picked her, Wall Street executivesgushed to CNBCabout the wisdom of the decision, particularly the fact that it signaled Biden was not, as we have been endlessly told, moving significantly left.That brings us to the second point. It’s becomingincreasingly clearthat Biden is planning an administration that is roughly on par with, if not more conservative, than Obama’s, but with afar less popularand inspiring standard bearer at the helm. While Biden himself lacks the charisma and grass-roots base to be an effective caretaker of a dysfunctional, crumbling system, it’s a role that Harris — who has thegenuinely rabid fan baseand history-making attributes missing from Biden’s candidacy — could ably step into, in a way that a relative unknown like Karen Bass, or someone with less charisma with no popular base like Susan Rice, could not.With Biden’s campaign focused on letting the public see and hear as little from their diminished candidate as possible, expect to see the lion’s share of attention and propaganda devoted to boosting Harris. Expect, too, to see Harris deployed to justify any reactionary measures a President Biden could not by himself.Harris may well have the Obama-like charisma to rally the party’s rank and file, and sell them on a conservative policy program, as the former president did. But this also carries risk: it would still be Biden’s presidency, and she could end up chained to the boulder of whatever unpopular measures he may pursue.On the other hand, she would be poised to lead the party once Biden is gone from the scene, thus neutralizing any future left-wing takeover of the Democrats and keeping both the party and Washington firmly in the hands of the corporate establishment.Lastly, Harris fulfills Biden’s desire to find a vice president with whom he’s on the same wavelength. Put aside the superficial differences, and Biden and Harris are essentially the same politician. Both have been chronically on the wrong side of history; both pursued cruel, right-wing goals for most of their careers in order to advance their personal ambitions; and both have a habit of misrepresenting their beliefs and records. It’s fitting: Biden, after all, isone of the old-school originatorsof the corporate-friendly Democratic politics that Harris has pursued her whole career.Call it absurd, or call it paradoxical. But as the United States is engulfed in unprecedented civil unrest over brutal police repression and its people rage against historic wealth inequality and corporate domination, the Democratic Party has chosen as its avatars one of the leading architects of that system, and one of its most enthusiastic foot soldiers.Both Harris, and to a lesser extent, Biden, have shown a limited but encouraging propensity to gesture leftward under pressure. The current unprecedented conditions, coupled with thestill small but growing powerof the US left, mean the next four years aren’t necessarily doomed to be a repeat of the Obama years.We’ll see if that makes the difference between getting the systemic change needed to stave off disaster, ormerely gettinga “student loan debt forgiveness program for Pell Grant recipients who start a business that operates for three years in disadvantaged communities.”\n",

Similarly, about 50 percent of respondents to an informal poll I ran on Twitter recently reported that they had “opposed Warren from the beginning” and exclusively backed Sanders.Nevertheless, people who support or sympathize with the candidacy of Elizabeth Warren have continued to oppose the effort to rally voters behind Biden’s best and most viable opponent. I’m not interested in relitigating here why I think this has been a mistake. Instead, I just want to lay down a marker.D.D. Guttenplan:At some point, we probably will have to choose. The Iowa caucuses in early February should help clarify matters, and the New Hampshire primary the following week is a test of strength both Sanders and Warren need to win.Hamilton Nolan:. . . since the important thing is that either Bernie or Warren win, whichever of them is losing by Super Tuesday — March 3, 2020, when a slew of important states hold their primary votes — should drop out and throw their support behind the other.Julian Brave NoiseCat:If either fails to make a strong showing in the first three primaries — signaling they have no real chance at the nomination — they should probably drop out and throw their support to the other.I could go on. Repeatedly, advocates of this “truce” have conceded that the grim realities of delegate math must eventually prevail over indecision and ambivalence. I think it’s clear that these people are not going to end their campaign for Warren just days before the first votes are cast. But here, I want to propose — no,beg for— a compromise:Please, for the love of God, do the math and end this after Iowa.As it standsright now, Bernie Sanders is likely to win around 1,250 delegates, and Elizabeth Warren, 463. Even if we imagine some improbable scenario where one gets to claim all of the delegates that the other wins, this only gives us 1,713 delegates between them. That’s nearly 300 short of an outright majority — and it’s even less than Biden’s likely total, 1,750.Delegate pooling cannot beat Biden. It doesn’t get you a majority, or even a plurality. The only way anyone can beat Biden at this point is if they significantly over-perform expectations, and the obvious way that happens is if they build a head of steam in the early states and then dominate on Super Tuesday. That just can’t happen if Sanders and Warren are splitting delegates in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.Let me be clear: I don’t think that a Warren win would be an acceptable outcome, I don’t think she would collaborate with Sanders to beat Biden, and I absolutely think that Sanders should stay in all the way until the convention regardless of what happens before then.But if you’re a Warren voter who says that your priority is beating Biden, you need to recognize the importance of building momentumimmediately. No kicking the can even further down the road. No appeals to “symbolic” or partial victories. If Warren loses in Iowa, she should end her campaign — and even if she doesn’t, anyone who wants to stop Biden should get behind Bernie Sanders. Or better yet, they should get behind him now.\n",

            "article content: Interview byAqsa AhmadOn Sunday, a seventeen-year-old high school student in Philadelphia found herself featured in a Joe Biden campaign ad. Which she thought was weird, because she is an ardent Bernie Sanders supporter.Sabirah Mahmud, the national logistics director for the US Youth Climate Strike, was at Joe Biden’s presidential campaign kick-off rally in May 2019 to ask him to commit to a forum on climate change. Biden failed to give her a proper answer, but his campaign had no problem using a shot of Mahmud from the event, in her hijab, in a new campaign ad, asBuzzfeedreported earlier this week.was just used as hijabi clout for the@JoeBidencampaign, too bad i'm#hotgirIsforbernie🥵😌pic.twitter.com/YtjoYJh1C3— sabirah ☾ (@sabirahmahmud)February 3, 2020Jacobin’s assistant editor Aqsa Ahmad spoke with Sabirah Mahmud on her interactions with Joe Biden and appearance in his campaign video, the challenges faced by student organizers in the climate movement, and how we need a Bernie Sanders presidency to enact meaningful climate change policy.This interview has been edited for clarity.Aqsa AhmadYour tweet about being used as hijabi clout in a Joe Biden campaign ad went viral this weekend. Can you explain why, as a Bernie Sanders supporter, you were at a Joe Biden rally in May last year in the first place?Sabirah MahmudI’m with an organization called the US Youth Climate Strike. At the time, I was working on a state level, and we were urging presidential candidates to have a climate debate, which we did see inthe climate forumthat happened a few months ago.During that time, we were getting our members to go to presidential candidates’ rallies and ask them these hard-hitting questions, and making sure they give us an answer on the spot. We had responses from Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Andrew Yang, but the only person we were missing was Joe Biden. That was a big press at the time because everyone was still riding the Uncle Joe hype.So at the time I was told, “Hey, you’re one of the most prominent organizers in Philly. Joe Biden will be here. Do you think you can come?” I went — three hours early, so it was a very long wait. I ended up getting to the front and having a chance to talk to him.I was asking him about the climate debate and explaining my organization, who I am. He interrupted me and was trying to seem like he knew better than me, saying “yeah, I know everything,” blah, blah, blah — just being like a white man explaining something to a brown kid. It was really odd. But he didn’t answer my question.Aqsa AhmadIt’s funny that they used thatparticular shot of youbecause you don’t look too pleased to be there. Why do you think the campaign included you in their video?Sabirah MahmudI honestly still have no idea why I was in it because I never said thank you so much for your time, I support you — I didn’t say any of that. I literally just came for that question. I feel like I was just used for face value. It’s not like I was chanting, it’s not like I was clapping or smiling. It’s not like I was so enthusiastic like every single other person in that campaign ad. I had a stern face. So it doesn’t really make sense at all why I’m in that video other than for purposes of, like, profiting off my hijab or something like that.Aqsa AhmadWere you surprised by Joe Biden’sresponse to your questionasking if he would commit to a forum on climate change policy, that “I’m the guy who did all this stuff . . . I started this whole thing back in 1987.”Sabirah MahmudYeah, I was surprised. When you meet someone like that, you’re obviously astonished and super overwhelmed by the hype. But after thinking about how he responded to me, I kind of realized how bullshit it was — how it wasn’t okay, the fact that he spoke on top of me and didn’t even let me speak, didn’t let me ask my question.And even after he stopped, he was like, “Yeah, I’ve been doing this” [climate change action]. I was like, “But will you commit to the debate?” And he was like, “Yeah, just send it” [to his staffers]. After I walked away, I was like, what does he mean by that? I didn’t get any card, no staffers came up to me after that, no one told me anything.I didn’t even get what I was there for, and in turn I get used for his own profit. And this is something that really was so hard for me because [it was] during Ramadan. I had to break my fast just to not faint. As a Muslim, it really did break my heart, the fact that I had to break my own fast just to ask that question and I didn’t get the right response, and now I’m just used for clout.Aqsa AhmadCan you talk to me about how you came to organizing on this issue and became involved with the US Youth Climate Strike in the first place?Sabirah MahmudI got a random email from the US Youth Climate Strike. It was essentially a call for me to join and talk about this new initiative for March 15, which was the first global strike day. I joined the call, and I was really intrigued by the idea, because I’ve heard of climate change all my life. I was really interested to take action, especially with theIPCC reportcoming out and too many other things that were building up to this movement, so I started organizing.My family’s from Bangladesh. My dad’s seven siblings and their children are in Bangladesh. The last time I went to Bangladesh was around 2012, and I got caught in a flood. My own nephew passed away from a flood. Around then, my uncle kept on posting stuff on Facebook about the pollution in Bangladesh, how there’s so much air pollution that they can barely live. It really broke my heart. That’s when I started passionately getting involved.While I’m in this country, my family’s still struggling in Bangladesh, and it’s not getting better. My dad’s only sister — her house is on this really narrow road, and due to the water rising, that road is kind of breaking off. No cars can even go onto the road to [her] house. So in the next few years, if the climate crisis doesn’t get better, her house could get dislocated from the main road, and she wouldn’t have any way of getting out.That’s the reason why it’s so scary and why I’m so eager to fight on these issues. In the moment I spoke to Biden, it was really frustrating — how I have so much experience, my family is literally suffering, but he would invalidate that by [talking about him] doing something about climate change in the ’80s.Aqsa AhmadHow have your friends, teachers, and classmates responded to the climate strikes, and what are the challenges or misconceptions you and your fellow organizers find yourselves coming across when organizing on climate? We publish a lot of articles here atJacobinabout why strikes and collective action are so important. You’re a high schooler — how are your teachers and classmates responding when you say, “we’re organizing a strike on Friday and we’re not going to school”? I imagine some would say, “Oh, can’t you just do this on the weekend or something?”Sabirah MahmudYeah, they definitely have said that — “Why don’t you strike on Saturday?” And I was like, “What are we striking from exactly?” I sometimes would go around my school and give talks, and people would just be like, “What’s the point? You’re causing a disturbance.” Historically, strikes have been [done] by people who have jobs, but more strikes are happening, more walkouts, more organizing rallies [by students].This is something a lot of organizers will tell you about — we’ve lost friends or opportunities from organizing. Even with school, it’s been hard to balance the two. My friend recently got a truancy notice for [missing school] for strikes, and it’s really worrisome because now we’re getting reprimanded for these things.Aqsa AhmadWhat do you think it will take to enact climate change policy?Sabirah MahmudA Bernie presidency, honestly. I don’t think any other candidate will ever understand this much about the climate crisis. They don’t understand as much as Bernie does, and they don’t listen to us. Who else has actually come to a climate strike and stood in solidarity with us? No one. Bernie has, though. He did that in Iowa, and that’s the way that we need people to get involved. He’s the one who’s been in movements, who’s stood with us in the streets, whereas other candidates will tweet their support from their closed offices. He is actually coming to the people and listening to us, which is what all candidates should do.He’s been vocal and concrete in his beliefs. He’s going against the [status quo] by supporting Palestine. And then there’s also the Green New Deal and Medicare for All and all these things that should be rights, because as a Muslim we know that we shouldn’t deny anyone something that should be a right, like getting medical help.Aqsa AhmadWhat’s your take on the environmental policies and stances of the other 2020 candidates?Sabirah MahmudThey don’t understand the environmental impacts. They don’t really understand that it’s not a future thing. It’s something that’s happening right now.Candidates try to say, “Oh yeah, we’ll take these preemptive measures, we’ll do it in a a few years.” They may not see it, but there are climate disasters happening around the world and in this country right now.Us youth are literally scared of the future. I have to take the SAT in a few months, and I’m just dreading it because I don’t even know — by the time I graduate college, will there even be an earth? Will I even have the opportunity to have a job? Will there be an ecological disaster? I don’t know, and it’s really scary.\n",

            "article content: Tonight’s Democratic presidential debate will be sponsored byPoliticoand PBS, simulcast by CNN, and moderated byPoliticochief political correspondent Tim Alberta, along withPBS NewsHour’s anchor and managing editor Judy Woodruff, senior national correspondent Amna Nawaz, and White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor.PoliticoandCNNhave demonstratedtimeandtimeagaintheirsystemicandinstitutionalanti-Sandersbias. Who canforgetPolitico’spieceshowing Sanders standing next to a tree with dollars for leaves, or CNNcutting awayfrom a Sanders speech to show an empty podium with the chyron “Standing By for Trump to Speak”?But as an individual, PBS’s Alcindor has a long and documented history of hostile, unfair coverage of Sanders.Earlier this month, in fact,NewsHourand Alcindor werecriticizedfor their rather stunningomissionof Sanders from acampaign storythatmentionedand showed images of Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Sestak, and Steve Bullock. Somehow there was no time or space for Sanders, who has generally been the number two candidate, behind Biden, inpollsof Democratic primary voters.The panel Alcindor hosted following the report mentioned Biden, Buttigieg, Warren, and Michael Bloomberg — but, again, not Sanders.This is far from an isolated incident; Alcindor has repeatedly used her articles, tweets, and media appearances to portray Sanders in an unflattering light. She has used innuendo to suggest Sanders is too old to run for president or, shockingly, was partly responsible for a mass shooting. She has asked loaded questions to suggest that Sanders’ refusal to drop out of the race was sexist, perpetuated theevidence-free“Bernie Bro” narrative, presented Sanders’ supporters as “idol” worshipers, and sanitized antisemitic tropes used against Sanders.It should be noted from the outset that Alcindor is anexperienced,accomplishedandaward-winningjournalist, who did exceptional reporting onTrayvon Martinand theFerguson protestsatUSA Todaybefore being hired by theNew York Timesin 2015. (She left theTimesfor PBSNewsHourin 2018.) This stellar overall record makes her heavily slanted Sanders reporting all the more jarring.In June 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia, a lone gunman shot and injured five members of  the Republican congressional baseball team, including Rep. Steve Scalise. The shooter — James T. Hodgkinson, who was killed by police in a shootout — turned out to be one of the hundreds of thousands of volunteers for Bernie Sanders. Alcindor used this to link the shooting to Sanders and his supporters in general, in anarticlethat claimed, in headline and body,  that the “Attack Tests Movement Sanders Founded.”FAIRrespondedwith an action alert: “With Sleazy Innuendo, NYT Lays Virginia Attack at Bernie Sanders’ Feet” and encouraged its readers to contact theNew York Timesand “ask for more responsible coverage of the Virginia shooting incident.” Media critic and FAIR contributor Adam Johnson explained:New York TimesreporterYamiche Alcindorstartedwith a false premise and patched together a dodgy piece of innuendo and guilt-by-association in order to place the blame for a shooting in Virginia on “the most ardent supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders.” We learned … that the shooter, James T. Hodgkinson … had been a Sanders campaign volunteer, and that his social media featured pictures of the Vermont senator and his brand of progressive, anti-Republican language. This was enough for Alcindor to build a piece based on the premise that Sanders’ “movement” had been somehow responsible for the attacks, and was thus “tested” by them.Johnson was not exaggerating when he called out the “innuendo” in the article, which suggested that violence was the natural result of the dangerous messages Sanders’ supporters get from “their idol”:The most ardent supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders have long been outspoken about their anger toward Republicans — and in some cases toward Democrats. Their idol, the senator from Vermont, has called President Trump a “demagogue” and said recently that he was “perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country.”Now, in Mr Sanders’ world, his fans have something concrete to grapple with: James T. Hodgkinson, a former volunteer for Mr Sanders’s presidential campaign, is suspected of opening fire on Republican lawmakers practicing baseball in Alexandria, Va.That shooting on Wednesday … may prove to be an unexpected test for a movement born out of Mr Sanders’ left-wing, populist politics and a moment for liberals to figure out how to balance anger at Mr Trump with inciting violence.Alcindor also suggests that Sanders’ rhetoric is as hate-mongering and “dangerous” as Trump’s. Never mind that Sanders practices and preaches aphilosophy of nonviolence, while Trump regularly engages indehumanizing language, praised a member of Congress whoattacked a reporter, and had his name invoked in at least nine physicalattacks. What mattered for Alcindor was that “some of Mr Sanders’s supporters had earned a belligerent reputation for their criticism of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party and others who they believed disagreed with their ideas.”To support her point, Alcindor even quotesMichael Savage, an Islamophobic, homophobic, Trump-supporting shock jock, whom she sanitized as “a radio host” “on the political right”: “I warned America the Dems constant drumbeat of hatred would lead to violence!” And she quotes Bill Mitchell, whom theWeekly StandardhascalledTrump’s “unofficial Twitter mascot”: “The Left in this country is ushering in a new #CultureOfViolence where violent hate is the new normal.”Alcindor’s concern about politicians inspiring violence in their adherents appears to be highly selective. She never wrote a piece, for instance, about how Hillary Clinton’s campaign was “tested” by the actions of actorWendell Pierce, a Clinton supporter who was charged with battery after assaulting a female Sanders supporter in Atlanta. Nor did she write a piece on anincidentin which astraightwhite male Clinton donorhita young woman of color with his hand and cane.The outcry over Alcindor’s article was not limited to the Bernie camp alone. Many Clinton supporters, and even veterans of the Clinton campaign themselves, have pushed back on Alcindor’s comments.Brian Fallon, Clinton’s national press secretary in 2016, replied to Alcindor’s article bytweeting: “A hideous act was carried out by someone who backed Sanders. That doesn’t mean Sanders incites/condones violence.” The sentiment wasretweetedby Jennifer Palmieri, director of communications for the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign.Alcindor also employed a variation of the“some say”/“people say” dodge —so popularwith Fox News — asking Sanders during apress conferencein June 2016: “What do you say to women who say that you staying in the race is sexist because you’re standing in the way of what could be the first female president?” Sanders responded:Is that a serious question? … Your question implies that any woman … who is running for president is by definition the best candidate…. Is your point that it is sexist for any man to oppose her?Alcindor followed up, “My point is that if she has more delegates than you tomorrow…that if you stay in the race, is it sexist?” At which point Sanders replied, “I don’t think it is sexist.”One can forgive Sanders for questioning whether Alcindor’s question was serious. Presumably, she would not have asked Clinton if she was being antisemitic by standing in the way of what could be the first Jewish president — thoughantisemitism, not justmisogyny, was a factor in the 2016 race.Even accepting Alcindor’s arbitrary “more delegates” threshold, was Clinton racist in 2008 because she didn’t drop out immediately and endorse Barack Obama? There are several reasons a candidate would stay in a primary race, even after victory is mathematically impossible — including, notably, an interest in shaping the platform at their party convention. To suggest that not dropping out of the race was “sexist” diminishes the real fight against sexism.But Alcindor stood by her question,tweeting, “Some women think @BernieSanders will be standing in way of history tomorrow if HRC wins and he doesn’t concede. He got testy when I asked; Oh well.”Talking Points Memoreportedon the exchange with a headline that parroted Alcindor’s framing: “Sanders Gets Test After Reporter Asks If He’s ‘Sexist’ For Opposing Clinton.”And theWashington Postwrote, “Sanders himself got into a testy exchange with a femaleTimesreporter,” even suggesting that Sanders’ sexism was responsible for his response to Alcindor:We can’t assume that Alcindor’s gender was a factor here. It’s possible that Sanders is simply sick and tired of questions — from anyone — that suggest he is stubbornly clinging to a shot at the nomination that doesn’t really exist.To make things worse, thePostarticle ran under the headline “The Bernie Bros Are Out in Full Force Harassing Female Reporters.” It was accompanied by a photo of a woman with egg dripping from her hair.A female reporter being harassed by Bernie Bros, as the headline suggests? No, itturned out to bea Trump supporter who was egged after giving the finger and reportedly making anti-Mexican remarks to a crowd of largely Latino Trump protesters, who had no particular connection to the Sanders campaign.Several days later, after the article and photo had been widely circulated, thePostreplaced the image and added an editor’s note:An image that originally accompanied this post on The Fix‘s main page and appeared in a video in the post depicted a woman being egged. Given the headline and context of this post, the photo could have been misconstrued as a reporter, which it was not. It was of a Trump supporter at a rally last week in California. The photo has been changed.It’s hard to see how the photo could have been anything but misconstrued.A few days after asking the senator from Vermont if his failure to drop out of the race was sexist, Alcindor tweeted that Sanders shouted “shun the nonbelievers,”  “stay in the race” and “Bernie or bust” at a rally she was covering. To be fair, Alcindor did delete the tweet andissueda correction — hours after it had been pointed out that Sanders had not said any of these things:CORRECTION: @BernieSanders SUPPORTERS shouted “Shun the nonbelievers,” “Stay in the race,” and “Bernie or bust,” at rally. Tweeting late.It’s very plausible that a reporter could accidentally omit the word “supporters” from a tweet. But it’s noteworthy that Alcindor made the same mistake on another occasion,tweeting,“Rosario Dawson mentions @HillaryClinton ‘s name and @BernieSanders boo loudly.” She never corrected or deleted that tweet.Alcindor’sNew York Timesarticlelikewise claimed that “many” at the rally shouted the same slogans cited in her tweet. Several attendees  responded that they didn’t hear these chants. (Indeed, it seems unlikely that many people would chant the awkward phrase “shun the nonbelievers.”)Alcindor wrote several other articles that presented anti-Sanders opinion as fact: “Inquiry Into Bernie Sanders’ Wife May Tarnish His Liberal Luster,”read oneheadline. “ Is Bernie Sanders, 75, Too Old for 2020? His Fiercest Fans Say No,”read another, which insinuated that only Sanders’ most zealous supporters, and not his normal ones, were OK with his age.One particularly negativearticle— admittedly, a “news analysis” and not a reported piece — revealed Alcindor’s disdain for the senator. The article, headlined, “Hillary Clinton Made History, but Bernie Sanders Stubbornly Ignored It,” claimed thatdespite the crushing California results that rolled in for him on Tuesday night, despite the insurmountable delegate math and the growing pleas that he end his quest for the White House, Sen. Bernie Sanders took to the stage in Santa Monica and basked, bragged and vowed to fight on.In a speech of striking stubbornness, he ignored the history-making achievement of his Democratic rival,Hillary Clinton, who became the first woman in American history to clinch the presidential nomination of a major political party.The piece continued:The raw math is brutal and indisputable. … This would be the time, under normal circumstances, for a primary rival to acknowledge insurmountable odds, pay tribute to a prevailing opponent and begin the work of stitching together a divided political party. … That was the conciliatory message that a vanquished Mrs Clinton delivered eight years ago to the day, on June 7, 2008, four days after Barack Obama had sealed his party’s nomination — a contest that was mathematically closer than the one with Mr Sanders now. … Party unity, it seems, is the farthest thing from his mind at the moment.Alcindor and her co-writer,Michael Barbaro, somehow forgot that before dropping out, Clintonsaidshe did not “buy the party unity stuff,” and, in fact, justified staying in the race because Obama could be shot,warning, “We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated.” TheNew York Times, in fact,reportedthat these offensive comments “stir[red] uproar.” Yet eight years later, the 2008 Clinton campaign was recalled only as “conciliatory” and an exemplar of party unity.Alcindor’s digs at Sanders were petty. Shetweetedout a menu from Sanders’ chartered flight to the Vatican in April 2016, apparently to suggest that the rich fare offered made Sanders a hypocrite. It became enough of a narrative thatSnopesweighed in on it, clarifying that “the menu was not any different from Delta’s commercial and charter flight offerings for Spring 2016.”While Alcindor went out of her way to portray Sanders’ supporters unfavorably, she seemed to sanitize a Sanders critic who lobbed antisemitic tropes at the senator. In April 2016, while covering Sanders speaking at the Harlem’s Apollo Theatre, Alcindortweeteda video of a man she identified as “John Prince, a community activist,” who “interrupted@BernieSandersto shout about gentrification.”Alcindor left out some important context: AsReal Clear Politicsand several other outlets reported, the man had been shouting questions at Sanders based on antisemitic stereotypes:The Zionist Jews — and I don’t mean to offend anybody — they run the Federal Reserve, they run Wall Street, they run every campaign. … What is your affiliation to your Jewish community?Her video captured only the tail end of the exchange, meaning that the “community activist” had already asked Sanders about the “Zionist Jews.”If Alcindor’s first tweet ignored the antisemitic content of the rant, her followuptweet(accompanied by a more audible video) presented them without comment: “More of protester John Prince saying he wants to know about @BernieSanders’ ties to Jewish real estate owners,” she wrote, as Prince said:The giant Zionist Jews … they’re buying real estate, and they’re selling it ten times the value. What is Bernie’s affiliation? Everything he says goes against Wall Street, the big banks, and the federal reserves. Those are his family.Alcindor’s uncritical framing of the protestor’s demands was condemned by several people on Twitter, Jews and non-Jews alike, including supporters of Hillary Clinton, one of whomtweeted, “#ImWithHer but I don’t want to give credence to these types of attacks.”To be fair, Alcindor did refer to antisemitism in thearticleshe wrote on the Apollo event, describing the “protester” as “interrupting the Vermont senator with antisemitic remarks.” And Twitter is different from journalism. But at the very least, aNew York Timesjournalist should be expected to clarify.One can hope that as a moderator Alcindor will treat Sanders with the fairness that all candidates deserve, but the prospects are dim. After the June Democratic debate, Alcindor approvingly tweeted an exchange between Sanders and moderator Rachel Maddow. After Maddow asked Sanders about his gun record, the senator responded, “No, that’s a mischaracterization of my thinking.” Maddow replied, “It’s a quote of you.”As former Rhodes scholar Maddow no doubt understands, quoting someone and mischaracterizing them are not mutually exclusive. Sanders wasnotclaiming that Maddow misquoted him, but rather that she took the quote out of context — which she did, by only citing part of it. EvenPolitiFactdeemed Sanders’ assertion of mischaracterization to be “mostly true.” Unfortunately, but predictably, most corporate mediareportedon Maddow’s retort as a gotcha moment.Alcindor,tweetingthe exchange, wrote, “Journalism at work, folks.” Let’s hope this form of “journalism” doesn’t dominate tonight’s debate.\n",

            "article content: In case there was any doubt, the last month has made clear that the Right is ready to do away with what little democracy we have in the United States. The congressional hearings on the January 6 Capitol riots have providednew evidenceabout the extent of former president Donald Trump’s determination to overturn the 2020 election results. At the same time, the right-wing Supreme Court has issued a series ofdecisions— on abortion, Miranda rights, climate change, and more — that amount to a judicial power grab, one that’s stripping ordinary people of their basic rights and hobbling the political system’s ability to confront some of the major issues of our time.In its next term, the court could further undermine democracy by allowing state legislatures tounilaterally decidethe outcome of presidential elections. Meanwhile, a significant number of Republican legislators and candidates continue to maintain that the Democrats stole the 2020 election — andtwo-thirdsof GOP voters seem to believe them.One would hope Democrats would respond to all this by denouncing the right-wing extremists, holding those who participated in the attempted coup responsible, and directly challenging the Supreme Court’s antidemocratic power.But rather than clearly condemning far-right election conspiracies and coup supporters, in some races Democrats are boostingextremist candidatesin GOP primaries with the hope that they’ll be easier to defeat in the general elections. (If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the same approach thatHillary Clinton’s campaigntook to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential primary.) When it comes to the Supreme Court’s attack on reproductive freedom and other rights, Democratic leaders have also beenfrustratingly complacent— offering little more than hand-wringing, fundraising appeals, and calls tovote harder.As towhypeople should vote for Democrats, it’s not clear what Biden and company mean to be offering. They are, of course, to be preferred to the increasingly reactionary death cult that is today’s Republican Party. But it seems unlikely that will be a sufficient pitch, with the party having failed to enact much of itspromised agenda, a cost of living crisis at thetop of most voters’ minds, and the president’s approval ratings atrecord lows.If Democratic leaders stay on their current course, there’s a good chance the GOP will win big in the midterms, strengthen their hold on state legislatures, and potentially even win the White House in 2024. Yet that isn’t a fait accompli; Democrats have plenty of room to maneuver. Perhaps in part due to the January 6 hearings, 58 percent of Americans believe Trump should be charged with a crime for his role in the Capitol riot, according to a June 17–18ABC News/Ipsos poll. Cori Bush, one of the four Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) members in the House of Representatives, has introduced a bill calling for the expulsion of congressmembers who were involved in the events of January 6. If the Biden administration and Democratic leadership were serious about holding lawbreakers accountable, they would support Bush’s legislation and call on Attorney General Merrick Garland to prosecute Trump and his allies.The Supreme Court’s aggressive encroachments on civil liberties and democratic rule deserve an equally strong response. Democratscouldimpeach right-wing justices for lying under oath, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezhas suggested, or propose term limits for judges. They couldpack the court, or simply defund it. They could point out that other comparable countries don’t grant their high courts such extraordinary power and beat the drum, day after day, about the need to rein in the Court’s powers for the sake of ordinary people’s well-being. Biden could open federal lands to abortion services. He and other leaders could use the bully pulpit or othermeans of leverageto get conservative Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to agree to remove the filibuster so that Congress can codify abortion rights into law.Removing the filibuster, of course, is also a precondition of passing other badly needed legislation, like the climate measures and welfare state expansions thatdiedin the Build Back Better negotiations. Measures like that, which could offer significant material benefits to working people, would in turn give the Democrats some positive, popular material to run for office and potentially stop theirbleedingof working-class votes to the Republicans.Neither the president nor congressional Democratic Party leaders are doing any of these things. Perhaps out of a commitment to “moderation” for its own sake, a fear of empowering theparty’s left flank, or a principled attachment to antimajoritarian institutions like the Supreme Court, Democratic leadership seems okay with letting the Right trample all over them. (Last week, Biden did belatedly issue an executive order to protect abortion rights. Though it fellwell shortof what activists were calling for, it appears unlikely that the administration would have done even this much without pressure from the Left.)The only national leaders who seem to be taking these threats seriously, and offering solutions, are democratic socialists and progressives like AOC, Bush, and Bernie Sanders. It appears, as with so much else, that the Biden administration and Democratic congressional leaders will take action against the Right only if the Leftforces them to— and our ability to do that, outside of using our own bully pulpits, will likely depend onmass mobilizationand electoral challenges against centrist Democrats, as well as clear-eyed denunciations of right-wing extremism. Organizations like DSA can organizedisruptive protestsfor abortion rights, for instance, and primary politicians who refuse to abolish the filibuster or take other actions to disempower the Supreme Court; as part of this broader push for democracy, they can rally to demand charges be pressed against those who committed crimes on January 6.Because of their public platforms and resources, national progressive leaders like Sanders and the Squad have a key role to play here. They can call on their supporters and others disaffected with the political establishment to protest and to run against do-nothing Democrats, and help organize them to do so. With Democratic leadership asleep at the wheel, it’s up to socialist and progressive leaders to fight demoralization by articulating a political alternative to both right-wing reaction and centrist fecklessness — and rally their supporters behind that vision.Leftists who insist on theurgencyof the right-wing threat to democracy are correct. Democrats won’t take that threat seriously unless we make them, and that means fiercely challenging Biden and party leaders on their failures so far.\n",

            "article content: This article was featured in the fall 2022 print issue of Jacobin.Subscribe todayfor just $19.95 a year.Amid intermittent “Let’s go, Brandon” chants erupting at a Donald Trump rally in Conroe, Texas, in January, state agricultural commissioner Sid Miller summed up his party’s mood in the lead-up to the midterms: “It’s no longer about Republicans and Democrats. It’s no longer about conservatives and socialists. You know what it boils down to, folks? It’s a race between patriots and traitors. It’s that simple.”Fueled by historically low levels of trust in institutions and off-the-charts polarization — not to mention persistent and growing inequality — Republicans have embraced the specter of civil conflict and turned national elections into referenda on American democracy.Even if the most extreme liberal warnings about a Trumpian dictatorship are overblown, the fact remains that the Republican Party has been radicalized in recent years to an alarming extent. Indeed, 147 members of Congress voted not to certify the election of Joe Biden. And there’s more of them on the way — 60% of Americans this fall will have an election in which one of the candidates on their ballot is an explicit election denier. To make matters worse, more than 80% of Republicans now believe that “our country needs a powerful leader in order to destroy the radical and immoral currents prevailing in society today.” No one can say exactly what will happen after 2024 if any number of the relatively small factors that saved Biden in 2020 go the other way. Yet even in the best-case scenario, Republicans will continue to institute increasingly draconian policies in the many states they govern, and workers and the poor will continue to suffer from their rule.Turnout vs. PersuasionThere are two basic schools of thought on how Democrats can stop the GOP’s assault on democracy. One wing of the party contends that turning out more voters from the progressive base is key. Progressive political strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio, for instance, explained in an interview on theVoltspodcast that “Biden won 2016 voters by around a 1.5 to 2 percent margin; he won 2020 first-time voters by 12 points. It matters to turn out new people.” She believes that keeping the Right at bay hinges on offering a bold liberal vision that will motivate the base to turn up on Election Day — even if that vision might alienate those on the fence: “The fact of the matter is that the Democratic base is largely people of color, and if we are not attending to issues of racial justice, climate, women’s rights, immigrant rights, et cetera, we have a mobilization problem. We have people not turning out.”Yet others contend that turnout is simply not enough. William Galston and Elaine Kamarck, for instance, note that while turnout increases among Democratic voters were indeed historic in 2020, turnout on the Republican side was similarly astronomical — the Trumpers being just as fired up as the Resistance. As a result, “because voters in both parties surged to the polls in record numbers, the shape of the electorate changed only marginally. . . . Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential contest not by changing the shape of the electorate, but rather by improving his share of the vote in key parts of the electorate.” In particular, they write, Biden’s vote share among men jumped to 48% compared to Hillary Clinton’s 41%, his margin among college-educated white men rose from 3 to 10 points, and he even made substantial gains among non-college-educated whites (31% to Clinton’s 23%), all leading to the somewhat surprising conclusion that white men were critical in Trump’s 2020 defeat.The national numbers obscure another crucial reason why Democrats need to supplement base turnout with persuasion efforts. In four of the five states Biden flipped — Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona — the white non-college-educated electorate was larger than the white college-educated, black, and Hispanic electorates combined. Democrats have no chance of controlling the US Senate without consistently strong showings in these states, and that cannot be achieved without reaching beyond the Democratic base.Simply put, there’s no way to stop the antidemocratic putsch without winninga lotmore white, non-college-educated voters, while also stopping the bleeding among non-college-educated Latinos, whose support for Trump increased by as much as 16 points in 2020 relative to 2016. Anyone who tells you differently is living in a progressive fantasy world.From Suburban to Working-Class BluesIn 2020, Biden was saved by educated suburban moderates with sufficient buyer’s remorse from 2016 — so much so that they preferred voting for a Democrat over returning Trump to the White House. Yet many of these same people have since shown that they are more than comfortable voting for candidates with politics as destructive as Trump’s but who don’t offend the norms of middle-class decency. Indeed, while Trump managed to capture just 36% of the independent-rich Virginia suburbs in 2020, the well-dressed, polite, and Trump-endorsed Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin garnered 46% of the suburban vote only a year later.The Democratsmayagain divert disaster in the 2022 midterms, thanks to a slate of abnormally terrible Republican Senate candidates like Herschel Walker and Dr Oz, plus an unearned electoral gift from the Supreme Court (Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization) firing up anyone — left, right, or center — concerned about abortion rights. That all may motivate educated suburban voters once again. But those who favor more egalitarian politics cannot hope to prevail in the long term by banking on quirky turns like a noxious presidential candidate or a once-in-a-generation Supreme Court decision.Even if Democrats are able to fend off a Republican government takeover in the short term, they must confront the slow creep of what anthropologist Arjun Appadurai has called “democracy fatigue.” Ordinary Americans are experiencing increased political alienation, causing them to lose confidence in government institutions and turn to antidemocratic alternatives. If Democrats can’t find a way to reverse this trend, as Bernie Sanders’s 2020 campaign manager Faiz Shakir bluntly summarized on theWildernesspodcast, “people are gonna move to the authoritarian autocrats who want to disrupt [the system] because [they think] the whole government ain’t worth shit.”The sociologist Jennifer Silva vividly captures how working-class Americans’ frustration with the state of American democracy leads many to either sit out elections entirely or support outsiders like Trump. Silva recounts her conversations with a 24-year-old African American construction worker named William in Northeast Pennsylvania leading up to the 2016 presidential election. William says he “has no intention to vote. I don’t see no point in voting. . . . Everything’s just all screwed, you know. . . . our country is ran by the government and big business. Which isn’t worried about the small guy.”Yet if William were forced to pick a candidate, “It probably would end up being Trump.” Trump, the young worker tells Silva, didn’t have a background of being involved in politics. “He just wants to take out the bigger people. Which is right, all the big organizations, he wants to split them up. Cuz they take out all the small people.”Working-class defections to the far right or to the sidelines of American politics, combined with the nature of the US political system — especially the Senate’s geography that grossly enlarges the influence of Republican voters — suggests that we had better find ways to refurbish progressives’ allure among persuadable working-class voters in pivotal districts — and find them fast. Because it’s no longer just a question of Democrats needing to win but of them needing to win big.As data scientist David Shor argued recently, even if Democrats get 51% of the vote in 2024, the GOP still “could win not just the presidency and both houses of Congress — they could get sixty Senate seats.” This would give a Republican president, possibly Trump, “more power than anyone in American history since FDR. It could make the Reagan Revolution look like child’s play.”Can MAGA Be Divided?But even that 51% might be too optimistic. Democratic politicians already face an uphill battle with their appeals to suburban moderate voters, historically a Republican voting bloc. Winning durable majorities would mean moving the battle to even less hospitable terrain, namely non-college-educated voters who are currently enthralled by Donald Trump. With levels of interparty animosity at historic highs, how could Democratic candidates even get Trump voters to hear them out?Of course, many or even most non-college-educated Trump voters may resist, reject, or sneer at Democratic candidates’ overtures. But Biden’s gains among this group relative to Clinton should reassure us that there are grounds for hope. And even if we assume that many of those inroads came down to Biden being a more “relatable” candidate, that still leaves many votes up for grabs. There is a substantial group of Trump voters who are driven, at least in part, by frustration with politicians’ failed promises and apparent incapacity to deliver meaningful material gains to working-class people. Democrats just need to effectively tap into this frustration.Recent scholarship, however, finds little evidence that class-based economic appeals to Trump voters are likely to tip the scales. Alan Abramowitz’s careful study of Democrats’ capacity to win back white working-class voters finds that the class divide between college-educated and non-college-educated voters “appears to have little or nothing to do with economic self-interest and everything to do with the diverging racial attitudes of these two groups. . . . Efforts by Democratic leaders to win back the support of white working-class voters who have been voting for Republican candidates in recent years by appealing to their economic interests,” he claims, “are unlikely to bear much fruit.”Abramowitz’s sobering conclusion is supported by recent academic literature finding that while economic insecurity may fuel support for right-wing authoritarians like Trump, the reverse appears untrue: political parties’ support for economic redistribution seems to make little difference in their electoral fortunes. So despite the fact that many polls have uncovered support for progressive economic policies among Trump’s base, that does not mean many of those voters could be persuaded to support Democrats based on progressive economic messaging.Many Democratic pundits agree, claiming that the party shouldn’t waste its time wooing non-college-educated “deplorables” who are driven by racial, not class, resentment. Joshua Holland, in a post-2016 election autopsy forRolling Stone, implores us to “stop obsessing over white working-class voters”: “Any effort,” he says, “to court voters who are animated by racial grievance wouldn’t just be morally dubious, but would also risk alienating the fastest-growing groups within the Democratic coalition. Non-college-educated whites represent a demographic that’s in decline as college graduation rates rise and the electorate becomes more diverse.”Along similar lines, Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher describes non-college-educated white voters as “a shrinking, increasingly resistant market” for Democrats — one that it just doesn’t make any sense to try to win back. “We’re spending all of our resources on broadcast television chasing this mythical unicorn white swing voter,” he told theNew York Times.As we know, however, it’s not just working-class white voters who are abandoning the Democratic Party but also Hispanic voters. This fact underscores a key insight missed by commentators who think working-class white voters are a lost cause for Democrats: the working class — including working-class whites — is an extremely diverse group. On partisanship, for example, 44% of working-class whites are reliably Republican voters, 33% are reliable Democrats, and 24% are independents — half of whom may be considered genuine swing voters. There may not be a wide path into the MAGA heartland, but there is a path.Amazon and McDonald’s Workers to the Rescue?To better understand which Trump-curious working-class Americans may be open to Democratic appeals, it helps to take a closer look at occupational differences among working-class voters. The political scientists Peter Hall and Georgina Evans found that two groups of working-class voters who supported Trump in substantial numbers hold among the most progressive views on economic issues: manual laborers (including factory and warehouse workers) and workers in service roles that employers consider less skill-intensive. This latter group, what I will refer to, for lack of a better term, as “low-skilled service workers,” includes delivery drivers, baristas, custodial staff, cashiers, and telemarketers. According to a recent survey by theCenter for Working-Class Politics(CWCP), “available voters” — defined as those who do not identify as strong supporters of either party — from these groups supported Trump in 2020 by a margin of 53% to 47%. For comparison, 56% of available voters without a college degree supported Trump, and 44% supported Biden.There are a number of reasons why manual and low-skilled service workers fall so far to the left on economic issues — and why they have moved progressively further left over the last several decades. In essence, they boil down to the fact that these workers have a particularly strong material interest in restoring economic opportunity and security for working Americans. Manual laborers are more likely than other Americans to have personally felt the impact of losing a good job to automation or outsourcing, and of having to find a lower-paying job with no security and few or no benefits. For their part, low-skilled service workers are the most likely of all voters to hold precarious, low-quality jobs with no prospects for advancement — jobs that most Americans would never willingly take.While other voters may express positive attitudes toward progressive economic issues in general, in most cases, their commitments to those policies are overwhelmed by other factors — partisanship, noneconomic issues, candidate quality — on Election Day.Is it possible that Democrats can connect with manual and low-skilled service workers through progressive economic policy commitments, even as these appeals fall short with other working-class Americans? If so, the electoral implications could be substantial, since manual and low-skilled service workers make up around 22% of available voters from 2020 battleground states, and since there is real potential for increasing turnout among these voters — especially available low-skilled service workers, whose abstention rate in 2020 was 35%, between four and five times higher than among middle-class voters.And it is clear that manual and low-skilled service workers are receptive to turnout or persuasion appeals: the CWCP survey found that 30% of low-skilled service workers either switched from not voting for a Republican to voting for a Republican or from not voting for a Democrat to voting for a Democrat between 2016 and 2020 (not voting for a party in 2016 can mean either voting for a different party or not voting at all) — more than any other occupational group.To test whether manual and low-skilled service workers might be more likely to support Democrats who make progressive appeals to working-class voters’ economic self-interest, the CWCP survey presented thousands of hypothetical Democratic candidate profiles to 1,650 voters, all of which included a range of economic campaign priorities related to jobs, taxes, and the minimum wage. Since a candidate being a Democrat or a Republican is such a strong predictor of support, and since campaigns do not occur in a media vacuum, all hypothetical candidates were explicitly identified as Democrats, and their profiles were preceded by one of several different opposition messaging frames.The survey found that employing progressive economic policy messaging around jobs had a large effect among low-skilled service and manual workers — even after accounting for partisanship and opposition messaging. These candidates rated as much as 10 percentage points higher than those who employed alternative appeals.The specific policies favored by manual and low-skilled service workers were a $15 minimum wage and an ambitious federal jobs guarantee to provide all Americans with a stable job at a living wage. These findings are in line with other recent surveys that have found focusing on good jobs is a winning strategy for Democrats among working-class voters. By contrast, progressive economic appeals had a minimal effect on non-college-educated respondents as a whole.What’s more, while issues that are often understood through a cultural lens — like guns, abortion, and immigration — helped to shape the candidate preferences of low-skilled service and manual workers, these issues were far more influential among non-college-educated voters as a whole. In other words, there is a substantial group of working-class voters who are generally pro-Trump but who appear much more open to progressive economic appeals and less susceptible to right-wing cultural appeals than other working-class Trump voters.Another Populism Is PossibleA growing number of politicians and strategists within the Democratic Party have begun calling for candidates to campaign in more explicitly populist, “us-versus-them” terms pitting ordinary Americans against economic and political elites. Progressive activist and strategist Jonathan Smucker, for instance, advocates a left-wing version of populism he terms “inclusive populism.”He explained to me that his “version of populism actually names and stays focused on the economic culprits: the billionaires, Wall Street, and the big corporations that have rigged the political system to dismantle the gains of working people.” This means instigating a fight that goes beyond the GOP and includes Democrats who “have been doing the bidding of those economic culprits.” The other side of the polarization, for Smucker, is articulating a “we the people” that’s inclusive of everyone else.Advocates of this approach came together at a recent conference in Washington, DC, to compare notes and work on a shared path forward. As one of the event’s organizers, political writer Adam Jentleson, explained to theNew York Times, “Democrats must find a more effective way to meet working-class voters where they are, and channel their very real anger — or else Republicans will.”Armed with fresh data from a survey of working-class voters commissioned by the advocacy group Fight Corporate Monopolies — which found that voters across the political spectrum are concerned about the outsize influence of corporations in American politics and would be persuaded to vote for candidates who proposed solutions to curb corporate power — Jentleson claimed that “a populist economic message is highly effective, and it’s crazy that Dems aren’t already moving in this direction as fast as possible.”Yet not all progressive strategists agree that demonizing economic elites is a winning strategy to reach working-class voters. A multiyear collaborative research project by a range of progressive advocacy groups found that if Democrats hope to reach more non-college-educated voters, they should certainly not cast corporations as heroes — but neither should the latter be portrayed as the unequivocal bad guy. The report concluded that “people push back on statements that broadly indict corporations or the rich, and they counter with specific examples of corporations and wealthy people doing good things.”To get a clearer sense of how the question of economic populism might play out among different groups of the US working class, in the same survey mentioned earlier, the CWCP presented respondents with hypothetical candidates who incorporated a range of populist-style appeals into their campaign messaging to see which, if any, affected working-class Americans’ perceptions of Democratic candidates.Some candidates highlighted the need for more politicians to listen to ordinary or working Americans, and some framed a sharp contrast between people who were being “sold out” and corrupt political elites, while others put the tension between working Americans and superrich economic elites front and center — similar to the messaging style used by Senator Bernie Sanders during his presidential runs.The survey found that while Sanders-style economic populism was viewed favorably by available voters overall, it performed no better than messaging focused solely on the need for politicians to listen more to ordinary Americans.Among the key demographics of low-skilled service and manual workers, however, only candidates using Sanders-style appeals performed better than those who avoided any populist-style messaging, indicating that voters in these groups find economic populist appeals particularly persuasive. This is consistent with previous research that has found frustration with political and economic elites to be a key driver of support for populist politicians among working-class voters. And economic populist appeals only had an effect among manual and low-skilled service workers, not among all respondents without a college degree. This means that the importance of economic populism to key working-class constituencies would be hidden if we only looked at non-college-educated voters.Likewise, while candidates’ class had a minimal effect on non-college-educated respondents’ views of them, candidates from a non-elite background were much more popular than upper-class candidates among manual and low-skilled service workers. For instance, moving from an upper-class candidate to a pink-collar worker candidate like a teacher or a nurse led to an 8.4 percentage point increase in support among these voters.Putting all the pieces together, the CWCP survey found that reaching a key group of Trump-curious working-class voters is possible if Democrats focus on progressive economic issues related to jobs, employ economic populist messaging pitting ordinary people against economic elites, and run candidates from non-elite backgrounds.The Broad Appeal of Left PopulismManual and low-skilled service workers may be among the most promising groups Democrats can reach with a left populist approach, but they are far from the only ones. The same study showed that candidates who take this approach are also appealing to key groups within the Democratic coalition, including African Americans and rural voters.Among black respondents, candidates who ran on a jobs guarantee were more popular than all other candidates. Candidates who ran on a jobs guarantee were supported by black respondents in 58% of contests, whereas candidates who ran on a small tax hike for the rich, for instance, were favored in just 46% of races. For their part, rural respondents were favorably inclined toward economic populists relative to non-populists and preferred candidates with a jobs guarantee plank over all other candidates.There is also little reason to expect that left populism will alienate other key constituencies in the Democratic coalition. For instance, college-educated and professional respondents (such as doctors, lawyers, and professors) were just as open to economic populist messaging and non-elite candidates as they were to other messaging styles and candidates — though they were less favorably inclined toward a jobs guarantee. Self-identified liberals also had positive views of candidates who used economic populist messaging, and they were more likely to approve of candidates from all class backgrounds than of upper-class candidates.Finally, the CWCP survey tested the effect of candidates employing populist-style messaging against the Democratic Party itself and found that virtually all groups viewed candidates who critiqued the Democrats for being out of touch with the needs of working-class and middle-class Americans favorably — even self-identified Democrats.Left populism offers Democratic candidates access points to a range of key constituencies without generating any obvious electoral liabilities for the party. They should give it a try.But What About Cultural Issues?Appealing to workers’ economic self-interest is all well and good, but won’t those efforts be undermined if Democrats focus on potentially divisive issues often referred to as “cultural issues” that might alienate many working-class voters who tend to be progressive on economic issues but less so on cultural ones?First, Democrats cannot avoid talking about cultural issues. As Shenker-Osorio explained, discussing the case of racial policy, silence on these issues “doesn’t mean those conversations go away. It means that the only thing our voters hear is the unrelenting race-baiting of the other side, which means our economic promises cannot cut through.”Similarly, the recent CWCP survey found that candidates who abstained from talking about cultural issues — including guns, abortion, and immigration — were among the weakest-performing candidates tested, suggesting that when candidates stay silent on these topics, voters simply fill in the blanks with a caricature loudly and eagerly provided by the Right.That said, the devil is in the details. Which cultural issues Democrats talk about andhowthey talk about them matter a great deal.While taking progressive stances on cultural issues did not help candidates in the CWCP survey, the degree to which it hurt them varied considerably. In some cases, it didn’t matter whether candidates took a centrist or progressive position. Available voters were no more or less likely to support candidates who took a centrist stance on abortion (such as supporting legal abortion until the second trimester) or a progressive one (supporting legal abortion in all or most cases).In other cases, like immigration, however, progressive messaging was a major liability. Candidates who ran on “commonsense immigration reform” were favored in 58.4% of contests, while those who supported “decriminalizing immigration” were favored just 42% of the time.Interestingly, though, among manual and low-skilled service workers, the favorability gap between candidates running on centrist versus progressive immigration positions was dramatically smaller than among non-college-educated respondents overall — there was a 10.4 percentage point difference among manual and low-skilled service workers, and a 17.6 percentage point difference among non-college-educated respondents — suggesting, again, that manual and low-skilled workers may be an ideal working-class target group for Democratic candidates.Not as Easy as It SoundsLeft-wing populist messaging isn’t anything like a panacea for the Democrats’ woes. Only a long-term process of rebuilding trust between working-class voters and the party — likely through sustained policy achievements that have a meaningful impact on the lives of working Americans — can produce the kind of working-class realignment we need in order to rid ourselves of Trumpism once and for all. And that, in addition to more effective messaging, would require a degree of organizational capacity and political leverage on the Left — particularly among the ranks of beleaguered private-sector unions — that today, sadly, still seems unlikely.Yet Democrats need to dosomethingto reach beyond their progressive base. If not, at best, they will be unable to implement reforms to improve the lives of working-class Americans; at worst, Republicans will consolidate a working-class coalition that hands them the keys to government for decades to come. Left populism is far from a sure bet, but it gives Democrats the best chance of reaching the persuadable working-class voters they need to win.And it’s not as if Democrats have always been opposed to left populism. Indeed, Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign relied heavily on a similar approach. As the writer John Stoehr explains, Obama “labored mightily to secure the support of voters in rusting industrial states like Wisconsin and Michigan, sending Joe Biden, the scion of blue-collar Scranton, to fire up crowds before joining in the attack of Mitt Romney, the corporate raider bent on tearing down the economy, as he tore down factories and good jobs.”With few exceptions, however, in recent years Democratic candidates have shied away from this kind of politics. As a result, in the words of historian Michael Kazin, Democrats have “had trouble articulating with force and clarity what kind of economy they believed in and how it would benefit most people who worked for somebody else.”Democrats have struggled to tap into the class-based resentment that Trump has been so successful in channeling. As Shakir describes, Trump “talked about corporations, named them by name, blasted them on Twitter, blasted them in public speeches more than probably any modern president in history.” Democrats would be well-served by following Trump’s lead in this respect — if not in any others.Finally, despite the clear evidence we have that working-class voters prefer non-elite candidates to wealthy, highly credentialed candidates, only around 2% of members of Congress are workers, and the overwhelming majority of Democratic congressional candidates have educational profiles that do not match those of most voters.For progressives to defuse the right-wing authoritarian powder keg, this all needs to change.\n",

It matters to turn out new people.” She believes that keeping the Right at bay hinges on offering a bold liberal vision that will motivate the base to turn up on Election Day\\xa0— even if that vision might alienate those on the fence: “The fact of the matter is that the Democratic base is largely people of color, and if we are not attending to issues of racial justice, climate, women’s rights, immigrant rights, et cetera, we have a mobilization problem.', 'Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential contest not by changing the shape of the electorate, but rather by improving his share of the vote in key parts of the electorate.” In particular, they write, Biden’s vote share among men jumped to 48% compared to Hillary Clinton’s 41%, his margin among college-educated white men rose from 3 to 10 points, and he even made substantial gains among non-college-educated whites (31% to Clinton’s 23%), all leading to the somewhat surprising conclusion that white men were critical in Trump’s 2020 defeat.The national numbers obscure another crucial reason why Democrats need to supplement base turnout with persuasion efforts.', 'In four of the five states Biden flipped\\xa0— Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona\\xa0— the white non-college-educated electorate was larger than the white college-educated, black, and Hispanic electorates combined.', 'Democrats have no chance of controlling the US Senate without consistently strong showings in these states, and that cannot be achieved without reaching beyond the Democratic base.Simply put, there’s no way to stop the antidemocratic putsch without winninga lotmore white, non-college-educated voters, while also stopping the bleeding among non-college-educated Latinos, whose support for Trump increased by as much as 16 points in 2020 relative to 2016. Anyone who tells you differently is living in a progressive fantasy world.From Suburban to Working-Class BluesIn 2020, Biden was saved by educated suburban moderates with sufficient buyer’s remorse from 2016\\xa0— so much so that they preferred voting for a Democrat over returning Trump to the White House.', 'Democrats have no chance of controlling the US Senate without consistently strong showings in these states, and that cannot be achieved without reaching beyond the Democratic base.Simply put, there’s no way to stop the antidemocratic putsch without winninga lotmore white, non-college-educated voters, while also stopping the bleeding among non-college-educated Latinos, whose support for Trump increased by as much as 16 points in 2020 relative to 2016.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization) firing up anyone\\xa0— left, right, or center\\xa0— concerned about abortion rights.', 'If Democrats can’t find a way to reverse this trend, as Bernie Sanders’s 2020 campaign manager Faiz Shakir bluntly summarized on theWildernesspodcast, “people are gonna move to the authoritarian autocrats who want to disrupt [the system] because [they think] the whole government ain’t worth shit.”The sociologist Jennifer Silva vividly captures how working-class Americans’ frustration with the state of American democracy leads many to either sit out elections entirely or support outsiders like Trump. Silva recounts her conversations with a 24-year-old African American construction worker named William in Northeast Pennsylvania leading up to the 2016 presidential election.', 'our country is ran by the government and big business. Which isn’t worried about the small guy.”Yet if William were forced to pick a candidate, “It probably would end up being Trump.” Trump, the young worker tells Silva, didn’t have a background of being involved in politics. “He just wants to take out the bigger people.', 'Cuz they take out all the small people.”Working-class defections to the far right or to the sidelines of American politics, combined with the nature of the US political system\\xa0— especially the Senate’s geography that grossly enlarges the influence of Republican voters\\xa0— suggests that we had better find ways to refurbish progressives’ allure among persuadable working-class voters in pivotal districts\\xa0— and find them fast. Because it’s no longer just a question of Democrats needing to win but of them needing to win big.As data scientist David Shor argued recently, even if Democrats get 51% of the vote in 2024, the GOP still “could win not just the presidency and both houses of Congress\\xa0— they could get sixty Senate seats.” This would give a Republican president, possibly Trump, “more power than anyone in American history since FDR. It could make the Reagan Revolution look like child’s play.”Can MAGA Be Divided?But even that 51% might be too optimistic.', 'Winning durable majorities would mean moving the battle to even less hospitable terrain, namely non-college-educated voters who are currently enthralled by Donald Trump. With levels of interparty animosity at historic highs, how could Democratic candidates even get Trump voters to hear them out?Of course, many or even most non-college-educated Trump voters may resist, reject, or sneer at Democratic candidates’ overtures.', 'Winning durable majorities would mean moving the battle to even less hospitable terrain, namely non-college-educated voters who are currently enthralled by Donald Trump.

There is a substantial group of Trump voters who are driven, at least in part, by frustration with politicians’ failed promises and apparent incapacity to deliver meaningful material gains to working-class people.', 'There is a substantial group of Trump voters who are driven, at least in part, by frustration with politicians’ failed promises and apparent incapacity to deliver meaningful material gains to working-class people.', 'Democrats just need to effectively tap into this frustration.Recent scholarship, however, finds little evidence that class-based economic appeals to Trump voters are likely to tip the scales. Alan Abramowitz’s careful study of Democrats’ capacity to win back white working-class voters finds that the class divide between college-educated and non-college-educated voters “appears to have little or nothing to do with economic self-interest and everything to do with the diverging racial attitudes of these two groups.', '. Efforts by Democratic leaders to win back the support of white working-class voters who have been voting for Republican candidates in recent years by appealing to their economic interests,” he claims, “are unlikely to bear much fruit.”Abramowitz’s sobering conclusion is supported by recent academic literature finding that while economic insecurity may fuel support for right-wing authoritarians like Trump, the reverse appears untrue: political parties’ support for economic redistribution seems to make little difference in their electoral fortunes. So despite the fact that many polls have uncovered support for progressive economic policies among Trump’s base, that does not mean many of those voters could be persuaded to support Democrats based on progressive economic messaging.Many Democratic pundits agree, claiming that the party shouldn’t waste its time wooing non-college-educated “deplorables” who are driven by racial, not class, resentment.', 'So despite the fact that many polls have uncovered support for progressive economic policies among Trump’s base, that does not mean many of those voters could be persuaded to support Democrats based on progressive economic messaging.Many Democratic pundits agree, claiming that the party shouldn’t waste its time wooing non-college-educated “deplorables” who are driven by racial, not class, resentment.', 'There may not be a wide path into the MAGA heartland, but there is a path.Amazon and McDonald’s Workers to the Rescue?To better understand which Trump-curious working-class Americans may be open to Democratic appeals, it helps to take a closer look at occupational differences among working-class voters.', 'There may not be a wide path into the MAGA heartland, but there is a path.Amazon and McDonald’s Workers to the Rescue?To better understand which Trump-curious working-class Americans may be open to Democratic appeals, it helps to take a closer look at occupational differences among working-class voters. The political scientists Peter Hall and Georgina Evans found that two groups of working-class voters who supported Trump in substantial numbers hold among the most progressive views on economic issues: manual laborers (including factory and warehouse workers) and workers in service roles that employers consider less skill-intensive. This latter group, what I will refer to, for lack of a better term, as “low-skilled service workers,” includes delivery drivers, baristas, custodial staff, cashiers, and telemarketers.', 'According to a recent survey by theCenter for Working-Class Politics(CWCP), “available voters”\\xa0— defined as those who do not identify as strong supporters of either party\\xa0— from these groups supported Trump in 2020 by a margin of 53% to 47%. For comparison, 56% of available voters without a college degree supported Trump, and 44% supported Biden.There are a number of reasons why manual and low-skilled service workers fall so far to the left on economic issues\\xa0— and why they have moved progressively further left over the last several decades.', 'For comparison, 56% of available voters without a college degree supported Trump, and 44% supported Biden.There are a number of reasons why manual and low-skilled service workers fall so far to the left on economic issues\\xa0— and why they have moved progressively further left over the last several decades. In essence, they boil down to the fact that these workers have a particularly strong material interest in restoring economic opportunity and security for working Americans.', 'In other words, there is a substantial group of working-class voters who are generally pro-Trump but who appear much more open to progressive economic appeals and less susceptible to right-wing cultural appeals than other working-class Trump voters.Another Populism Is PossibleA growing number of politicians and strategists within the Democratic Party have begun calling for candidates to campaign in more explicitly populist, “us-versus-them” terms pitting ordinary Americans against economic and political elites.', 'For instance, moving from an upper-class candidate to a pink-collar worker candidate like a teacher or a nurse led to an 8.4\\xa0percentage point increase in support among these voters.Putting all the pieces together, the CWCP survey found that reaching a key group of Trump-curious working-class voters is possible if Democrats focus on progressive economic issues related to jobs, employ economic populist messaging pitting ordinary people against economic elites, and run candidates from non-elite backgrounds.The Broad Appeal of Left PopulismManual and low-skilled service workers may be among the most promising groups Democrats can reach with a left populist approach, but they are far from the only ones. The same study showed that candidates who take this approach are also appealing to key groups within the Democratic coalition, including African Americans and rural voters.Among black respondents, candidates who ran on a jobs guarantee were more popular than all other candidates.', 'As the writer John Stoehr explains, Obama “labored mightily to secure the support of voters in rusting industrial states like Wisconsin and Michigan, sending Joe Biden, the scion of blue-collar Scranton, to fire up crowds before joining in the attack of Mitt Romney, the corporate raider bent on tearing down the economy, as he tore down factories and good jobs.”With few exceptions, however, in recent years Democratic candidates have shied away from this kind of politics.', 'As a result, in the words of historian Michael Kazin, Democrats have “had trouble articulating with force and clarity what kind of economy they believed in and how it would benefit most people who worked for somebody else.”Democrats have struggled to tap into the class-based resentment that Trump has been so successful in channeling. As Shakir describes, Trump “talked about corporations, named them by name, blasted them on Twitter, blasted them in public speeches more than probably any modern president in history.” Democrats would be well-served by following Trump’s lead in this respect\\xa0— if not in any others.Finally, despite the clear evidence we have that working-class voters prefer non-elite candidates to wealthy, highly credentialed candidates, only around 2% of members of Congress are workers, and the overwhelming majority of Democratic congressional candidates have educational profiles that do not match those of most voters.For progressives to defuse the right-wing authoritarian powder keg, this all needs to change.', 'As a result, in the words of historian Michael Kazin, Democrats have “had trouble articulating with force and clarity what kind of economy they believed in and how it would benefit most people who worked for somebody else.”Democrats have struggled to tap into the class-based resentment that Trump has been so successful in channeling.
