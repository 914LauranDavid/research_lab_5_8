de avut in vedere:
- sa am ce se cere in cerinta
- sa includ tot ce am facut practic (Datasets, cod etc.)

- cod+dataset pe teams!




Modelarea partii experimentale (capitol)
----------------------------------------
- what data
- what experiments
- how we validate the results
- what to compare the results with, in order to see our model is better than existing ones
- math model for the experiments

3 Modelarea partii experimentale
3.1 Datasets
copy from old hw; add what I wrote down (search all files in the repo) and what I did
3.2 Models
the 3 models + what parameters to use for bert
3.2 Experiments
run all models; try many combinations of parameters;
3.3 Evaluation metrics
3.4 Comparisons
what we compare with; on what data, with what adjustments (e.g. binarisation of my models' output); 
3.5 Math model



Case study (capitol)
---------------------
- creare/colectare de date
- implementare cod
- validare/colectare de date care arata eficienta abordÄƒrii propuse (metrici, evidente empirice)

4 Case study
4.1 Creating the left-right dataset
scraping; making 1 dataset with equal no. from each leaning;
4.2 Writing the models
technologies, environments, libraries; parameters; 
4.3 Results
4.3.1 Metrics of each model
(4.3.2 Concrete examples (maybe the small ones at the end of the notebooks))
(4.3.2 Comparison with others)



Related work (capitol)
----------------------
- others' approaches
- differences, similarities between me and others
- what metrics I expect to obtain better
- pregatirea validarii pe set de date folosit si de altii in articole

5 Related Work
5.1 Survey of others' approaches
5.2 Differences, similarities
5.3 Metrics I expect to improve - presidential elections, if not political media in general.
5.4 Preparing to validate on dataset used by others - semeval
